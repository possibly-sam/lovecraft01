Packing up from a hotel.  There were cats, dogs &amp; guinea pigs that had to be given back to the people who owned them &#x2013; the hotel no longer kept them.  Traffic jam at the elevator.

<p>
I placed some stuff in the bag to go, but then we couldn't find it.  We looked all over for it, through the living room and the two bedrooms that were connected off a corridor.  Eventually we gave up and said it was just one of those things and that they'd turn up.  Because not to do so would have dedicated the remainder of the dream to the search in a fairly tedious way.  Eventually they showed up stuck between the cushions of the sofa.

I was working in data entry and eating the credit cards.  I was actually a secret agent, so every day I would get a message about different places.  This one involved two places in texas &#x2013; one of them was Houston &#x2013; and one place on the east coast.  I printed out the map and the information, then would enter it it.  
</p>





<p>
I had a nice desk along a wall where I had printed everything out and had started to eat the credit cards when a lady came by to look at the work I was doing with the map.
</p>




<p>
I started worrying if all the eating of the credit cards was going to start affecting my digestion.  They crunched up nicely, but were still of course plastic.  I ate several of them at a time, so the pieces would have been &gt; 1mm.  I worried that they might tear my intestines.  All this worrying was happening in the bathroom of 1377.

<p>
There was a large field.  Maybe it was the white elephant outside Mechanic Arts but expanded.  All the school children were getting ready to play a game there, a type of war game.  Before they started, I stood on a mound near the middle and shouted out that all people who wanted to fight were idiots.  One of the teachers leading the event told me to leave, so I did.  
</p>

<p>
I went to a place where the sidewalk was divided in two and there were people on each side, trying to walk past each other.  I walked along with them, walking a dog on a rope leash, until we came to a corner.  At the corner, the street was filled with flowing, icy water.  I left them there.  They said it was too cold to get in and that the water would be too hard to swim through.  But I apologized for leaving them and got in.  The temperature was not too bad, and I was carried along the current with significant force, because this was the type of public transport they had for people who knew.  
</p>

<p>
The icy current carried me rapidly away and around a corner.  When it came to the next major intersection of the city streets, it stopped.  It said that I had run out of money because I had no job. $1900.  I had two choices.  To try to struggle uphill and forward, which would have been tedious, or to turn to the right and go downhill, which I could easily do for free.  It looked like there was some kind of park with bushes and equipment at the bottom of the hill.  Maybe a conservatory? I chose the easy path.
</p>

<p>
When I got halfway down the hill, I saw that it was actually a recruiting station for the army, and the equiment was military jeeps.  I certainly didn't want to join the military.  There was an artist community outside the gates of the military base, but they were mostly there to do ads for the military base anyway.  
</p>

<p>
I met a man from the base and was talking to him, trying to see what was around the corner to the right of the base.  The path turned into an old dirt path, there was a valley and then a hill that you couldn't see over.  I asked him what was over the hill and he said it was the wilderness and that there were wolves and mumblines.  We looked and saw them coming over the hill.  They were covered in a white gossamer covering.  I started to walk along the side of the base through the trees and bushes.

Three of us were going somewhere.  We had our tickets.  The line was long and moving slowly, so my mother said that she would be right back.  Soon the line started to move faster and I ended up getting on the bus alone.  It was on the way to some kind of a mystery solving event.  
</p>

<p>
But then my phone started to act funny, so I rebooted it.  I couldn't find the reboot button, but there was a reboot button on the bus which worked.  Unable to find the text message function on the phone &#x2013; a recurring element.  But when I rebooted it, it seemed to be part of the computer on the bus we were riding.

There were many groups doing plays in the school, all down a long hall.  The leader led me down the hall.  I was allocated to the Canadian contingent because of some loose connection.  They were doing great and were in the last room at the end of the hall.  In a dark room near the front of the hall I was wondering about how I would deal with it when I got new people under me.  Maybe I would bring them a care package.

I had prepared all the grades from class, including the statistical analysis.  We sat down at a picnic bench to review them.

One of the ladies at the table made a joke about it being the University of Minnesota as opposed to the University of Minnesota.

I got off the phone and got in my car.  The electrics started to flake out on the car and since I was in the back seat it was hard to drive.  The brakes stopped working so I put it in first gear and tried to drive along the wall to slow it down. I drove in the wrong lane and pushed pedestrians out of the way hoping it would stop.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I decided that the car was performing no worse than normal so turned around and went back to my destination.  I got to Clayton's apartment and rang the doorbell.  I had set up a calendar invite over a month ago.  My car was now a funny looking tricycle, which he took away.  We went inside and there was a huge party, with lots of his family and other friends of his family; a very middle class midwestern party with baked beans, kool-aid and cake.  
</p>



<p>
We sat down after some minor chit-chat. Other ladies who were attending the party came in with some shopping and sat down next to us.  Then the whole house disconnected from its mooring and began to be towed away.  I wasn't sure where we were going but since his father had been into houseboats, I assumed that we were going to go out to a lake or river somewhere.  I thought it would be a great picture to take to send to Gayatri once we got there and so decided not to call her yet.  I watched the shops go by as we rolled down the highway.

Trenton was in the basement.  He did something wrong and I wanted to tell him that it wasn't really very wrong; nothing to be ashamed of.  We had a problem with rats and I was trying to get rid of them.  I went around the house and was trying to take a shower.  In the middle of the shower I was interrupted because someone was doing a hold-up at a convenience store nearby.  Their rifle had a laser pointer on it and they were showing who they were pointing it at, threatening them, including me.  I lay down and tried to hide the fact that I was calling 911 on my cell phone (which was a feature phone).  I was unable to call without looking at it.  But by the time I pressed '9' a police helicopter was coming by &#x2013; someone else had already called them.  The police helicopter became a helicopter sized rectangle shaped like a tablet and I wondered how it flew.  Then a fleet of alien ships came from another direction.  The robbers had been with the aliens.  We ran into the brush and trees of the hills behind the store, thinking that if the ships had the ability to outpace us in the open, we had the knowledge of the back alleys.

I was in my bedroom in 1377.  I had failed at Math and was going to take the CompSci test, but I wasn't sure if I was going to pass.  The test was tomorrow so I had only one day to study.  I was very tired and was spending most of my time resting, just trying not to fill my mind with other things so that I could concentrate for the test.
</p>

<p>
I was in a field, trying to be sociable with a bunch of business people at a conference.  After I put in a token appearance that I tried to tell myself was adequate but which I knew wasn't (I was very tired), I went and sat down in the auditorium to listen to the speaker. 
</p>

<p>
It was Dan Johnson.  His presentation soon morphed into a preview video about  new movies that were coming, featuring mostly a new movie that Tom Baker was in &#x2013; Dan Johnson was Tom Baker.  Tom Baker was with some kids and they were running from some pirate ghosts.  But Tom Baker was able to dive back under the running pirate ghosts without getting caught by them and lead them away from the kids.
</p>

<p>
Then the movie became Hawaii 5 0 and we were all getting into 70's nostalgia.  The main character from Hawaii 5-0 was driving an amphibious car accross a bay and into a tunnell normally reserved for boats.  Then we were underwater with some underwater people taking a delivery of some fruit.  Some of it was from a different tribe and we apologized for our ignorance about the distinction.

I was talking to a guy behind a counter.  He was actually a mob boss.  We were comparing internet browswers.  I told him about my use of FireFox.  He asked which browser was best for a certian purpose.  I said Firefox.  He said "Really?" because it was a trick question:  you can't actually change the namespace of a variable.  He took a sidelong condescending glance at his friend and the conversation was over.  I walked away.

I sat on a bench a ways away from the others.  They were talking about some play.  It was a city street and it was the living room of 1377.  I made a point of getting some candy since I had brought some myself (see below) but they candy I picked up was not very good and it was wet and it stained my hand.  I went to the kitchen to wash it off.

The store didn't have stuff on the shelves (again) you just brought the sample to the cashier and they brought out the real thing.  But there was nothing explaining that so I was unsure what to get because I wanted to actually have it if that was not the case.  I got chocolate, mountain dew and 3 sandwiches.  They had lots of cake making material.

There were a lot of other people in line and it was hard to get around them.

I had to go on a journey up a hill, one which I had been on before in a previous dream.  I commented how the dream in fact repeated itself.  I had to take an umbrella (like Dr. Who) as a walking stick with me.  Sometimes it was hard to move forwards along the same path as the dream had previously, and so I had to push myself along with the umbrella like a walking stick.
</p>

<p>
But at a point along the dream, before the path wound up on a dust muddy path through some mountains, I saw a side path and took it.  I clambered over some rocks and came to an area where there were lots of old ladies and the houses were next to each other and the houses were clothes.  I wanted some cereal from them and figured that I could just walk in and start eating the cereal as I had in other dreams where houses are pillagable.  I pressed through the cracks between the clothes.  The old ladies didn't like it and I fell down into a dark cave.

We were in Children's theater, which was JCI.  There was an empty office and I was in there with some other people like Ajith &amp; Rahel.  Some more junior people were asking me when the mumble would get approved.  I said, in a very sarcastic way, "as soon as I know that I'm responsible for getting it approved".  Then Gayatri &amp; I had to leave and I wanted to go down the stairs but she wanted to take the elevator so we went to the elevator.  We saw mumble from Minneapolis come out of the elevator and we said hi to her.  The elevator was an open outdoor thing.  we stepped in and started going down.  Someone had their young sons with him and was allowing them to climb down the cable of the elevator which was at a 45 degree slant.  We said we'd never do that.

I was in a chair in a classroom.  The old kind like from the U of M that was all wood and metal and sloped upwards.  It was somwhat narrower than normal; dark &amp; dusty at the back.  I was finishing my homework on the computer, typesetting it and sending it in.  I thought to myself that this was where I belong, doing pure technical work.  
</p>

<p>
But then I had to answer questions from the students.  I had had my headphones on and hadn't heard them ask.  It was a question I didn't know the answer to; they pointed to the question in the textbook.  I tried to answer as best I could.  One time I said something that they knew not to be true and corrected me very animatedly.  
</p>

<p>
It turned out that that was the class before mine, a more advanced class and I wasn't even responsible for those questions.  I thought I would be teaching algebra and that it was started a couple weeks ago.  I thought it amazing that they were forgiving me for flaking out on them before and not finishing teaching the class I started teaching.  This had happened in a previous dream.  I thought that maybe they were so desparate for teachers that they would forgive.
</p>

<p>
I spent a lot of time messing around and collecting tests.  I would have a lot of tests to grade that night.  I thought that it was algebra but actually the professor came in and said that it was calculus and that it had just started, so I would be doing the first lesson.  Why it started later than the other classes I didn't know.  I didn't even have the textbook and so I was looking around to fake it as usual by doing some exercises from the book.
</p>

<p>
I needed to get home to do the homework.  I decided to walk to the bus stop which was a significant distance away.  But as I was crossing a bridge, a bridge that was like 35, I realized that it was 8:20 and that the last bus was at 8:20.  This was a bus that went by a circuitous route to near Highland Park.  I had had adventures in dreams missing it and being on the wrong bus before.  I was just at the kitty-corner bus stop when I saw the last bus go by.  It had gotten dark by then.

There was a brief moment when all the jobs were open and I managed to get a teaching job at a Mechanics Arts that was in a northern suburb as a teacher of games.  I thought it ironic that I had come full circle from having started War Games class at open school.  My teaching responsibilities were very light since I had come in when everything was open, but things were closed now so no one else was coming in.  My friend and I walked out of the lobby into the area at the front of the building.

One of my students had a complaint against her.  She had been involved in a study for the school of marijuana products but had only tried one, one provided by a friend of hers.  The complaint from a friend of a provider of a competing product was that she had not been objective.  I felt that although the study was weak, the complaint of unethical behaviour was over-reaching.  I kept rehearsing to myself how I would explain to her in terms of lessons learned and wondered if she would understand that language.
</p>

<p>
We met the complaintant sitting around a circular picnic table outside in the front of the building.  We managed to get agreement on a token punishment.  There were 4 of us.  I agreed to tell her.  I thought to myself that I would schedule a meeting for the next day.  I got up with a couple of coats and started walking away, thinking that I would get some lunch.  There were lunch places all along the driveway to the school and on the parallel street.

Gayatri and I were sitting on a bench in the mall at the U of M outside the Math building, Vincent Hall.  I had to ride my bicyle accross the Washington avenue bridge.  But there was construction going on and I couldn't get there through my usual route.  I asked one of the construction workers and he said that there wasn't a way.  But I saw some  people going through a different entrance so I started going there.  There was a very steep decline and I was concerned both that it wouldn't actually lead to a way accross the river and that it would be very difficult to get back up.  So I followed a path along a curve of the hill where some other people were going and it led to a corner of a city which was actually London.
</p>

<p>
I noted that I hadn't called Nate Longen in a while so I called him and left a message.  I was suprised when, while continuing to bike through the old wet brick streets with old unused trolley tracks, he called me back.  I couldn't hear his answers very well but I kept asking questions.  
</p>

<p>
Then we were in a bar and he again suprised me by suggesting that we get a second round.  He had a simple drink, I asked for a beer and we got into a long discussion with the waiter about the different types of beer they had.  First we had only the wine menu and then the beer menu wasn't the one I'd seen before at that restaurant, but rather something more descriptive and expository about their beer products.

Papa and Trent &amp; I were supposed to go to some fair/vacation type thing.  Papa got into the elevator and went down before I could get into it.  I followed him but he wasn't there when I got down so I figured that he had gone on.  There was a bathroom.  The mens was larger than the ladies, as usual.  The ladies sign was next to the mens with an arrow pointing the other direction and vice versa.  When I got inside the urinals were funny and I had to urniate over the toilet paper.  The cleaning lady was there and waited for me to finish before she replaced the toilet paper with a different type of dispenser.  It was very crowded.

<p>
I left the restroom and came out directly to the cafeteria, where I assumed that Papa was getting something to eat.  The direction was all backwards and I didn't know where to get what I wanted.  It was very crowded.

I left the cafeteria unable to find anything and started wandering along the hallways between the various restaurants in the vacation/fair type thing.  It was indoor but open to the air and it was very dark with lots of old dark wood.

I worried that Trent hadn't got the message that he was supposed to join us at the vacation/fair type thing.  I tried calling him but couldn't get through.  And how was he going to drive there anyway?  In a van down highway 13 near Shakopee?

When the singer was at my school three years earlier I had kept her writing on the blackboard waiting for her return.  She was now here again and she erased it and put a new one.  At one point her grafitti started to look like a swastika and I told her she'd better change it; it wasn't deliberate and she changed it.  She presented a video that she had made, it was a mash up of a bunch of different pieces with a lot of cameos from others.  She wasn't actually the famous singer but a second second side of the famous singer.  But she knew all these people and they helped her put it together so it was very appropriate for our school and lasted nearly an hour.

The journey between the two involved cutting through along a bridge.  This time I took the wrong bridge arch and ended up where it was rough ground to get to where you needed to be.  I knew because I had tried it in a dream before.  So I doubled back to go along the correct bridge arch.  But the banks of the river were crumbly and the branches that were there were loose.  It all came down with a great finality and plunged me into the water.  The rest of the branches came down on top of me and kept me under.  There was no question of being able to come back up as there might have been in a different dream.

On the streets of New York.  I had a job that gave me a place to sleep on a bench in a room full of other kids.  They had just sold part of the building to another company and we had to allow passage.  I went down in the basement through a garage where others were working.  I had to paste some pieces of ceramic together.  My boss came back from vacation and was being friendly.  I couldn't remember what he had been doing.  Skiing?  He had been on a beer tour of Holland. I had to go through the garage and didn't have any ID.  I was worried that people would stop me but everyone was very nice.

We were all waiting in an auditorium to be dismissed from school at the end of the day.  I had 'borrowed' a ladies sweater because I was going somewhere cold so I delayed my exit until she was gone so that she wouldn't see that I had it.  I had all kinds of warm clothes and was planning on wearing double layers when I got where I was going.

They were herding us.  We had to put all our stuff in lockers and then we were going to sleep in bunks.  I had a lot of valuable stuff like my passport &amp; UK visa in the locker and I didn't know if I would even be assigned that bunk.  And there were no locks.  Putting a lock on would have attracted notice.  
</p>

<p>
We had to go around room in a school/museum and they would play games with us.  Paint would drip out of the ceiling and we had to try to avoid it.  The paint never came off.  It was like being zombies.
</p>

<p>
They took us away and we were going to go over the Lake Street bridge from Minneapolis to St. Paul.  We were planning on walking accross the ice but the middle of the river had thawed and we couldn't get through.  Everyone turned around to go back but I didn't; I lay down on the side of the bridge.  To fall in the water would have been death because it was near frozen.  I fell asleep and woke up on the St. Paul side of the bridge.
</p>

<p>
I went to the school and was trying to avoid the worst of the games.  One of the teachers who directed us through the games fell in love with me.  I was concerned that people would see us hugging but she said that didn't I know, in her species the sexual organs were in the back so when people thought we were just spooning we were actually making love.  I felt an immediate sexual attraction and agreed to run away with her.  
</p>

<p>
We ran back over the Lake Street bridge from the Minneapolis side.  There were many people coming and going, above and through a subway.  It was vaugely victorian/cyberpunk.  She wanted to go on the left side where people from the UK would be going to the US but I said no, we should go on the right side because anyone we met there wouldn't know us; on the left side if someone passed us they might recognize us.

They had ads about how you should exercise during the pandemic, and which stated that light exercise was not the kind of exercise they were talking about.  So I got out of bed and went running.

I was in an elevator with maybe it was Charles Gormely.  We went up one floor to the storage attic before we were to go down.  He commented that they were keeping the dangerous chemicals right next to each other, just in different color drums, red and blue.  I said it was all just turpentine, wasn't it?  The elevator started to move along horizontally along the top floor where the storage was and then down a curving slope.  I commented on the bottles of industrial nitrate and said that that was the one that you needed to be dangerous.

I found a room with an office but then they were moving us around again and I was confused about where to sit.  One of the desks was a bed.  I kept staring at my notes thinking that there was something I should be doing.  I complained about where I was going to keep all my papers.  We were cleaning the place.  The cleaning spray created a brown foam that I had mistaken for dirt but when we scrubbed it away it was cleaner than before.  I was one of the most fastidious in cleaning.

Then I went past the train tracks that were used for artisinal crafts, past where thermo king had a supplier to the promontory south of lumbridge where I finally decided to smoke the pipe despite some others around.  They pointed out that this would bind you to the cycle of births and deaths and after about 3 you would morn your decision.  I decided to do it anyway for the chance to meet the entity that made it so.

On a camping trip with my father.  He was supposed to get the trucks to take our stuff to the next site.  He was giving a long explaination of all the details leading up to the delay.  I got bored and was gazing at the clock on the church tower over the river.

<p>
Then I went to breakfast where again he started giving a bunch of details about our whole itinerary.  I asked if I could just eat breakfast and get ready to go, which was the main point of it all anyway.  Everyone smiled.

The buffet line for breakfast was too crowded and they didn't have anything except sweets.  The cashier had an advertisement for a sugar substitute, I said if they were against sugar they should offer other options.

In the offices of CelTrak, they had set up a personal download of all ambient sound and other sensor information for a teenagers house who wanted to do it with some money they got.  I was wondering how much it cost and hanging out with them to learn about the technology even though I didn't need to because I didn't work there anymore.  It was $9 per 4k download and they were collecting data every 6 month - 2 years.

Down an escalator.  My girlfriend went on the other one and went past.  Then when it ended on the floor before, I had to try to find a way down.  I tried calling her but couldn't get the cell phones to work.  There was some confusion with some gentlemen on a conveyor belt.  I walked out the exit (where you clearly were not allowed to go) and turned left twice.  People were playing a role playing game as billiard balls but I walked past them.  I found the mens bathroom.  There were rules about what you could and couldn't take and you had to pay in Euro.  Then we were on an automated train track and the movement was smooth, but in a Rube Goldberg kind of way.

I got a carton of marlboro and gayatri knew about it.  She had me clean up so I took a bunch of stuff upstairs.  Upstairs was extended Sandy/Norma house.  I left it in my old room at sandies and took a matchbox from a huge pile of cigarette butts left over from when dennis was there.  I went up to the next floor and it opened to a park.  there were lots of people walking there and they could just come right into the house.  I smoked the cigarette despite the people there and felt an immediate sense of relaxation.

I was in a room trying to defecate in a baby's toilet.  Mark and Paul came in with some lady friends.  I had to ask them to leave.  I ended up with a mess all over my pants so I decided to go to a bathroom to change clothes.  The only bathrooms were far far away and there were crowds of people going to and from them, in a kind of shopping center complex.  Someone told me that was why they didn't like canada.  Finally I found a shower stall, I got completely wet and there were still crowds going past all the time that could see but I managed to change my clothes.  Everything was wet and I tried to dry them off a little, wringing them out.  I had missed some classes and was late for the bus, even late to borrow my father's car and drive.  The whole thing started from missing a plane.

Walking along the street with Prasad, I was having trouble getting words out and I hope he didn't notice.  He was showing how the Microsoft UML tool worked, but then there was one field you couldn't enter.  I said that was why I preferred the other vendors tools.  This was all up on a big marquee below a mezannine.  Then we walked back into a coffee shop.  He and Ajith sat down and ordered.  I had been there before and the barista remembered my order, but when I spoke to confirm I drooled and I hoped Prasad didn't notice.

Two 20 sided dice made of precious stone like diamond.  I took them and was trying to escape someone who wanted them from me.  I just barely got them in my pocket before he saw, but he still could see that they were in my pocket and was following me.  I came to some train tracks.  There was a low wire fence and some immigrants trying to get in.  I expressed solidarity with them and climed over the fence.  They told me it was not elecrified.  I tried to climb over without touching anyway but failed.  I started up a hill but then was in a bathroom.  Washing my hands I cut my finger and it wouldn't stop bleeding.  There were many people in the bathroom apart from the one who was chasing me and I asked them to get me a doctor.

Coming from a long way away through a downtown area with a school group in california.  Went into a playhouse ahead of the rest and thought they would follow.  Sat in the middle in the back.  A girl from Amsterdam started talking to me but I didn't have anything to say; I felt very dull.  I couldn't hear what the players were saying half the time and so I turned on my magnifying light to start working.  The playhouse was showing a movie with some hollywood B listers, who were doing a comedy version of a star trek episode.  In the star trek episode the enterprise had beamed down into klingon territory with the help of a half-klingon.  In this comedy version it was reversed and the klingons were going into federation territory with the help of a half-klingon.  The actors were getting up from the seats in the audience which was like a school room with big fake lazer guns.

Was in a math class with Clayton.  When we went to pick up our grades, he got a C and I got an F because I had missed the mid term and expected to make it up in the final.  I was talking to the teacher behind the classroom.  She was saying that I seemed to revel in foul news.  I said that while that may have been a legitimate criticism, it had little bearing on a math grade.  She was obviously immature and being coached by her husband who was also a teacher.

At 1377.  It was Dan Smith's going away and I had to get a bunch of suitcases for him from across town.  It was down a street that was like Snelling+Ford+Lake+92nd.  At first I was going to take the bus but then I decided to try to take the car even though my license has expired and the car had no gas.  It was that old brown Nova and Babaka had some mattresses and suitcases in the back seat.  It was a cold snowy day.  I started driving but realized that I wasn't going to make it so I turned around.  I went up a hill on a dirt road and had to push some to get the car all the way up the hill.  From the top of the hill where there was a little road, I went into a forest.  By a dirt cliff there was a big cat, which followed me.  The big cat and I were both single, loners.  I escaped it into a box canyon, which was a cave that the ceiling was coming down in.  I found a side exit to the box canyon up some stairs that went into a movie theatre where some kids were watching star trek.  I left with them into a concourse where we went up an escalator.  I managed to turn off my phone when it got to 5%.  There was a game on the phone that kept overriding the main operating system and I had to reboot to leave it.

As you walked along the path, the parallax of the trees in the medium and far distance was very pleasant.  I was looking for weed plants that just happend to be growing in farmer's fields.

Gayatri and I were sitting in Dad's old white car outside the airport, which was also TK.  A big truck with a government message on the back came and blocked us in.  I told Gayatri to get out of the car.  I was in the backseat.  I left and started walking away.  I was convinced that they were complete facists and determined to resist.  Someone came from the truck and told us to stop but I kept walking.  He sprayed something on my back as I walked away but it felt like just water.  I thought maybe it was paint so that I could be identified later.  He chased me into a hotel/restaurant.  I told him that wherever he told me to go I would go the other way.  We went through a door in the back of the kitchen and there were stairs.  He suggested we go up so I went down.  Not knowing if this was a double-bluff on his part.  I was able to leap down the stairs and get ahead of him.  I came out to a dungeon-cave area.  I found a belt which was way too long.  There was a snake which was a blanket and it attacked my follower.  I tried to stab it; that did nothing.  I tried to whip it with the belt; that did nothing.  I wrapped the belt around it tight and that immobilized it.  We started to leave.  I was worried that the snake, which was very small now, had gotten into my coat so I took it off.

I went back outside but Dennis' car wasn't there.  He came and we looked around but we concluded that it had probably been towed.  So he drove up a hill to where another parking lot of the same company was.  Where did he get the other car?  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.  He tried to get a ticket through the automated system, thinking that that would be the way to get his car back.  We waited.  There was a newspaper in a storefront right there.  It was the Shiite Review &#x2013; a play on Shi'ite and Shite; a suspected Irish nationalist paper. Soon all these rough Irish were crowding around us, having just come out of a meeting at the storefrount.  When the crowd cleared, Dad was gone!

There were two bathrooms and my line went faster so I was in front.  Someone from the other line went ahead of me and I got really angry at them.

Steve Hall was working in Shell, which was at the St. Clair Broiler.  I did some temp work for them upstairs.  I thought I was still getting money from them but then I realized that if I didn't bill I wouldn't get money.  Which made me feel relieved because I didn't want to take money from them under false pretenses.  Upstairs there had been a big array of office supplies and I had been told to do something with a bread board.  When I stopped by to ask if there were any new opportunities, he told me to check back later.  He was all dandied up like my Algebra teacher in grad school.  He said that they were still complaining about how I had made the bread board so small.  I thought that that just proved that they didn't know what they were doing and were all about appearences.  I was glad as I walked away out the door and down the street.

In the basement of a department store, someone was giving a class on painting.  You had to paint with oil pastel and then have the computer adjust the image so that the paint strokes would be more like that of a particular artist they were studying.  I asked about all this and why you couldn't just start on the computer.  It was a good result though, couldn't be denied.

The department store was also a museum and there were many modern works on display.  I had left a large board that I had found &#x2013; several yards by several yards &#x2013; there and I had started oil pastel on it and it was being mistaken for one of the works on display.

Coming home from over the highway.  When I came to the school there was a big puddle of water.  I had come accross this before.  I was able to skim accross part of it, but it went further and eventually I was swimming.   The last time I only had to swim a little bit but this time I was swimming all the way to the highway.  I took a wrong turn and started down a path to the railroad tracks instead of the bridge over the highway.  It was good I realized it and turned around because it was very hard to swim back uphill.

Riding my bike up a steep hill.  Couldn't make it and started to walk it.  Even then it was hard and I started to slip down the dirt.  Finally I made it to a trapdoor, which led to a starbucks that was closed.  I didn't want anyone to think I had broken in so I didn't wan't to leave by the front door for fear of tripping an alarm.  But what I thought was a side door also tripped an alarm.

There was a lady in the church who had the devil in her.  All the signs were there.  Someone was assigned to look after her.  When the devil finally came out of her, the person assigned decided they liked the devil better.  Comedy ensues.  A B film targeting a black audience.

In Thermo King, they made the bathrooms equal sized between men and women.  But a large part of the mens bathroom was showers which came on automatically and i started to get wet.

Maybe they had a ridiculous statement to make
About something they hadn't experienced
Possibly Sam had a different opinion
That nobody'd ever considered important
And damn it if Norman and Betty were listening
Somebody would have become a phenomenal
Howling lightning tampering with the electrical
Evidence shown to be relevant
Possibly with the exception of ivory
Everyone else had abandoned the obvious
Chipping away at erroneous garbage
Which definitely is as exciting as pudding
Deliciously spooned from the lap of the ludicrous
Into the mouths of the question less idiots
Licking their lips as their eyeballs are rolling
And flapping their tongues as they're losing their marbles
That's the way Sam's play around
That's the way Sam's play
Someone who wasn't related to anyone
Twisted the facts till the truth was apparent
And dished up a dollop of dubious doo-doo
That sparkled like something folks scrambled to swallow
Slipping the rich through the eye of a needle
Is easy as getting a camel to heaven
And granny transgressing had blubbered a bibful
Of classified info on Milton's imbroglio

Sitting outside a synagoge.  Well if you don't want to talk about god then don't come in here.  All the many people walking past me.  Looking for Gayatri, knowing I wouldn't see her.  Waiting thinking if I should just become a sage and sit there forever.  Knowing I would get lost if I tried to get up and find her.  Eventually I got up and pressed through the crowd to the edge of a valley. I flew through the valley and ended up on the streets of Minneapolis.

Coming home on the train, too tired from visiting friends in the north twice on different days.  Wanted the child to sleep.  Couldn't get sleep myself.  In a big dark room, I thought it was empty and that I could go to the bathroom, but there was another entrance and people were there anyway.  Trying to get food and drink; only that in my own home was satisfying.  Having a temp job but I didn't show up one day and they had me doing something unfamiliar in a different room.

Was going to run a mile in a work competition.  Hadn't exercised for a long time and worried about it; also about being the oldest person there.  Difficulty finding my clothes in my bedroom in 1377.  John Banks was there and I was complaining to him about being late.  Then Les came by and said it was time to go.  The elevator didn't go up all the way and I had to walk.  But finally we got to work and the event wasn't starting yet so I tried to go to the bathroom.  I was glad that I decided to come to work instead of just going to the event.  The first bathroom was a shower and I got wet.  The second one was a urinal for both men and women.  A young girl was talking about socialism and she put my penis in her mouth.  Then posed for pictures with my semen running down her chin.  It was the latest fashion among punks.

In a grocery store with Gayatri.  Arguing about how to push the carts.  She started eating a bananna before paying for it.  I explained to her that she shouldn't do that.

Lake street bridge.  When young I had gotten into a semi-truck and it rolled into an intersection.  I escaped but it was Grand Theft Auto and I was marked with guilt for life.  The Marshall avenue hill as a metaphor for my father's disappointment in me.  Trying to sneak up to a convenience store at the top of the hill with a little bit of weed in my pocket to smoke it.   I thought about going back for my pipe.  It was busy and I couldn't find a place to do it in secret.  One of the workers, who had down syndrome, tried to offer me a bag of candy.  I refused it politely and the other worker told him to accept my refusal.

Working at a new company.  They were trying to debug a system.  The messages had broken and were intermittent.  I said that they would have to revert the last 4 changes and put them in one by one to see where it had broken.  When I realized that the failures were intermittent I said it must be the CRC.  one of the ladies figured that out as well at about the same time.  We all gathered in a theatre for a presentation.  These people were very crass in the use of language and the ladies all wore red lipstick.  They were doing a demo.  It was all about selling wire.

I was in Econ class.  Mark was also there.  I remembered saying that I liked Econ.  I thought how vain I was to think that if I was good at math of course I could do Econ.  And what about the Geometry class I bombed.  The professor was asking why I was so tired.  Because of covid nobody was working.  I couldn't remember if I was in a week where there was shutdown or after it; I was transcending time.  So I tried to give him a generic answer.  He thought that if we weren't working at least we would be exercising more.  I said aw you know how it is even if your work doesn't involve putting boxes on trucks if you plan to exercise 10 times more often than normal you'll only end up exercising 5 times more often than normal.  My work had never involved putting boxes on trucks.

Stroganoph pool.  We were going to a lawyer who was used to dealing with extortion clients.  They were bent out of shape and constantly had to perform surgery on themselves, including a monty-python esque faux stereo brain surgery.  He set us down to a fancy meal including beef stroganoff and flatbread.  He would fill his swimming pool with beef stroganoff and swim in it while his guests were eating.  I asked for flatbread without meat and the waitresses just started taking the meat off with their hands.

She said that she wasn't going to bring the whole table out so could I just say what I wanted and she would see what she could do in that direction.  I asked for ice tea.  She looked disappointed and put upon.  Another waiter came and was cutting up fruit to give us pieces to bet with.  He asked if we wanted 2 pieces or 1.  I said 1 because I wanted to get going.  No one could think what to bet on.  So I bet that I would get 7 or more on 2 dice.  Clayton took the bet but the two others didn't.  I rolled a 10 and won.  Then I explained that the odds were in my favor.  I think Clayton knew that, he was just being sportsmanly.

In the bathroom cleaning up she stepped into the bath.  My nose hairs grew to thick braids about 4 inches long.  I asked her if I should cut them.

Some guys going out for dinner.  Trying to get enough rest on a day before an exam.  Also a lady who didn't have much money but she's going to make everything allright.  Is she going to become a prostitute?  Over the bridge.  Through the business I follow her.  It does not suprise anyone that we can leave.  She has the key and the boss hasn't arrived yet.  She borrows 24 dollars.  She says to meet me at a certain address.  Is it the rental car place?  Yes it is.  The deposit for a rental car is  24 dollars.  She doesn't have the money to pay the rest but that is not deterring her.  The guys walk past the store on the sidewalk.  I expect them to invite me to dinner but they just say 'see you tomorrow'.  So I guess that means that I am following her.  I put my backpack in the back seat.  It is a mini.  Where will we go?

In class I sat down, I was an hour late but the test was short &#x2013; only 4 pages &#x2013; and I expected it to be easy.  I went back and picked up the test after sitting down.

Gayatri and I were in our new farmhouse.  When I woke up the water was leaking.  I tried to turn it off but then the whole thing broke.  It was glass, and I told Gayatri, who was sleeping in a bed in the corner of the kitchen, to cover her face.  Then water was falling all over the place and I was trying to find the off switch but Gayatri was just saying to wait until we called someone to fix it because we didn't know where it was.

The car went in reverse backwards along a dirt driveway and I couldn't stop it but I could steer it.  I did (backwards) circles in a field until it slowed down.  Then it became a bike and I was trying to get a guitar through an amplifier on the bike but the volume was low.  Someone was watching me.

The Minneapolis airport.  They were going to change the name of the city to Pantiera or something like that.  It was just a row of concrete hangers before the sea.  I was in the morning for a night flight and I wanted to check out the gate early.  I got through with a different flight that was taking off.  Then I left my carry on and went to find the bathroom.  But the bathroom wasn't where I expected it and I ended up going out back past security.  Then I couldn't get back in to where my carry-on was left so I had to go to the counter and explain the whole situation.

Driving in the parking lot to C2 or B3 where northwest had their slot permanently allocated.  Inappropirate touching from a faux mystic who may have been professor vandendorpe.  Crawling clumsily accross people's laundry placed on a wall.

Going to see emily in minneapolis.  I had to take the bus. My dad brought both cars over and left them in a parking lot.  It was like, how am I going to get them home, I am not supposed to drive &#x2013; no license.  We decided I could.  Gas was low and I would have to get gas immediatly.  I went to emily's school and started walking down the hall.  But then I got a call from the service station.  They needed to move my car for something they were doing. They were also going to fix the tail light and wanted confirmation.  This was like a 'we wont tow you if you pay us and the excuse is we'll do this work'.  I had the money so I said yes.  I wondered where I got the money from and how long it would last.
</p>

<p>
I went to class.  I was late.  It was 1:05 when class started.  There was a class at 9:05 that I usually went to but I thought I would sit at this one.  It was the second floor of Mechanic Arts.  There was confusion about which elevator and which stairs.  I wasn't sure which room my class was in so I just guessed.  It was a nice social science classroom with a lot of books and cozy chairs, like a corner of a living room with a kitchen island.  I took a seat in front of some ladies.  They had thier feet on the chair and I had to move it.  I started to try to find my noteook.  My usual notebook is always full (this is not the first time this has happened) but this time I had some loose leaf pages with me and I was thinking that I would just have to figure out how to keep them together.
</p>

<p>
I was working on a sensors web application.  Gayatri was the product manager and Adam Raybin was working on the hardware.  I realized that I didn't know enough about the hardware side of it and that we weren't integrating enough.  It was Adam's living room.  He had a place right on the lake.  The tide came up and down and some people were playing on the stairs where the water was filling in.  One lady with a 3 string acoustic base waded back onto shore.  I started to leave and was trying to find my shoes.  It was after dark already and I had to take the bus.  Brad Skillicorn was there and wondering if anyone could give him a ride because he had to go to the next state.  There was a bunch of food lying around and I was wondering if I should eat any of it.

Getting the car out from between 2 parked cars on the ice north of University Avenue.  That was easy because I could just slide it but it was so hard to find the brake and so hard to stop.  There was a black lady in front of me who kept challenging me to stop as I went through industrial areas filled with rail crossings.

In a church.  Thinking about wearing a 93 necklace.  Wandering around.  Finally sitting down.  A pause in the sermon.  We started chatting with the kid sitting next to us who was complaining about not being able to get free information from his university.  First in a whisper and then in a normal voice.  I said all that stuff should be free.  He said but he is in the navy college.  I said that was different.  we got up and went to a table in the back.  He was very friendly, touching.  His father came over to talk to us.  There was an unopened boardgame on the table that had information about his hometown on it. Pittsburg.  The back was upside down from the front.

Music gathering in Dhann Poulnau's upper attic.  Only one person came, a lady who brought a drum.  John Banks was there.  He said that everone wants to be the class president.  I said there was only one class president but I thought he liked many subcommittes.  I thought John could play keys and me woodwinds and her percussion.  But of course I couldn't get any of the woodwinds to work properly &#x2013; they all had too many holes in them.  The girl gave us a cassette tape of her work and we played it.  It was labelled 'Hardware First'.

<p>
Then she started in on a tirade about how someone had cheated her.  While flashing a bunch of monopoly money around on the table.  I complained that I couldn't understand what her complaint was.  So she turned invisible and left.  I could just barely see her outline ripple as she passed.

Trying to go to the bathroom in the dormatory.  I thought the bathroom was empty but the corner stall was occupied.  Then it turned out 1/3-1/2 was full.  I finally couldn't do it.

<p>
Waiting to drive off in the car.  I was going to leave the house and I had no place to go but was going to live in the car.  I was trying to pack everything into the 'basement' of the car and the top.  My mother was on the phone and I had to say goodbye because otherwise I wouldn't have had enough time to pack.  I thought maybe I could just keep some of my stuff in storage where it already was.  I knew the place where it was kept, it was the last door on the left and then through all the stacks of books.

<p>
After sleeping a night in the car I was in a european city and I was thinking that we should publish all economic transactions so that the global price of everything was known.  The free market reaching its ultimate efficiency and everything being at its fair price would be the closest thing to not having currency that you could get while still having currency and would make the next step &#x2013; the removal of currency &#x2013; immanent.

Constantly worried about not having any money or any job.  Was thinking I could borrow from John Banks but he reminded me that I already owed him 2 days pay.  Riding down a highway a pengiun flew out of a truck and was caught on the hood of the lady driving behind.  From her dashcam you could see her slowing down to give the penguin a perfect soft landing.  Was there a parade of children behind?  Yes!

How do you do it?  I go to camps and I get the kids kicked out of the camps.  They don't know it.  Then we tell them they are being punished but they all end up here at this uber building fun camp.  And its time for the big end demo.

With Pablo in a shopping mall.  He went into a store and bought a rare book for &gt; 200 USD because he wanted to show me one picture from it.

They were trying to get the customer ID and code for a microsoft app.  They had it on a TV in the upstairs bedroom of 1377 and were on the phone to several friends to try to figure it out.  I put everything on mute.  It wouldn't go on mute so we had to disconnect.  I explained that Leila had set me up to be a microsoft reseller, so I was the one who technically sold the app.  Leila had signed me up for that.  Dennis looked at Leila askance.  If it appeared in the list mis-allocated it would trace back to me so they needed to stop trying to hack into it.

In a large hall; was it a church or was it a field; there were a few of us and we were planning an application.  Easier for me if it was mostly UI.  We outlined it and I said some words about quality.  Just mom and apple pie, right? But they started to rankle at that point.  One of the team expressed concern that we wouldn't make the deadline.  So I scheduled a meeting to go over the schedule.  It turned out to be similar to a sprint planning meeting where we would divide the stories into tasks and estimate each task.  I tried to write on the blackboard but it was low quality chalk and everything was blurry.  I wasn't even sure if it was my own handwriting.

Was in Lake Crystal.  They were building a new garage on the house next to ours.  There was a dirt alley in back that curved around.  What would happen when we inherited the house.  We went to the edge of town.  We were informed that they didn't like strangers.  For evidence we were told to push the walk button on the street light.  An indian lady who was crossing the street pointed us to it eagerly.  The street lights came alive in some kind of comic robot effect and pretended that it was looking at us and saying that we looked funny.  We then had to look into its eyes and it wouldn't let us cross until we did.  It displayed pictures of the Beatles and you had to pretend to look into thier eyes.  One of our party wouldn't do so but it let us accross anyway eventually.

I noticed the sky; it was made of foam.  The foam started to come down and I clawed my way through it.  Then above it was in the form of a waterfall and I was taken by the water fall down, unimaginably far down.  Eventually it landed near the s-curve and I was back to the place I started.

I felt like I made a much better second than a leader.  Prasad was explaining a project and I was taking notes and trying to expound on it, organize it.

I went into another room in the corner of the basement and Dan and I were playing with lego trucks that would explode.  We set them to go off and watched as they followed each other around the floor.

Showing someone the house with all the peculiar twists and turns.  I was getting ready for my wedding again.  I wasn't sure who I was marrying.  I put on my best shirt.  But then I picked at a scab on my shoulder and got blood all over it.

on wellesley avenue next to randolph heights.  I was sleeping in the afternoon so I decided that I would report a half day sick. Having problems scheduling.  Many TK engineers stuffed into the backseat of the car with me while I was trying to work on the laptop,.  They wanted to use a model that I had created.  but it was overkill for thier needs and I was trying to determine what they really needed vs. what they thought they needed.

<p>
Mixing cake with lunch in a hole by randolph heights.  I dumped it all out and tried to escape.  I left some of my stuff there but took their large cooking pot.  I thought that by going round the block, I would be able to escape because school was out.  But as I was getting to cross hamline, school got out.  they were high school kids instead of elementary.  I left the pot on the corner and crossed the streets.  Then some of the kids were running from someone as well.  I led them up the alley.  one of them had something in his eye and I told him to put his head down and blink.  we didn't get followed.

1st day back at work; work was an auditorium.  Prasad was supposed to be there but he was delayed; we assumed he was talking with Andreas.  There was a general meeting with other departments.  They were complaining about a bug where the software couldn't be used on a Mac.  In Prasad's absence, I asked if we could just go out there with our tools to do the upgrade for them; that would be cheaper for us than a new project to support Mac.  The service people thought that was possible.

Trying to get to work.  In the kitchen of 1377.  Nothing to eat quick except a cheese sandwich, but I couldn't find any mayonaise. Biking to work, I had left my car somewhere.  Work was like Snelling &amp; Laurpenteur except further east.  It was announced that KQRS was going off the air so I swung by there to ask questions.  Exquisite.  Holding the source within me.  Making love to emily. Trying to externalize it to make a double ended pipe.   Inside deeper than imaginable.  
They wanted to tell me all about the last station that went off the air but I only wanted answers to my questions because I was in a hurry.  What would the replacement format be?

<p>
Getting to work was being in the swimming pool in Highland High School.  The water circled around and came back along the ceiling and that is what powered life.  Sometimes hot glowing coals would fall along with the water.  I swam back to the other side, getting there quicker than expected, and then had to climb over shelves in the basement.  The trick was to use the base of the carosel instead of the moving part of the carosel.  There was lots of food on the shelves and TK trucks parked there.

Trying to get on a plane to go to Tokyo.  There was only a little time before the plane left and we were worried that we were going to be late.  Standing on a railing outside.  Got into the elevator in time.  But then didn't know which floor to go to.  Tried to follow the others but got lost in the parking ramp.  Ended up in the line for the wrong plane.  The stewardess told me that my plane was accross the airport through the fields and fences and behind the buildings and that it was unlikely I would make it even if I ran for it.  But I tried anyway.  I dodged some small planes taking off and hopped over some small fences.  I grabbed a pole and that turned out to be a good idea because the next step was getting in the water and pushing ourselves along with poles.  I joined the larger river and continued floating downstream.

I was in my Father's house.  But this was the one in the nice neighborhood.  I got stoned even though I knew I was supposed to go out the next day.  I stayed up just thinking.  I was playing my guitar and was confused about whether I was horizontal or vertical.  Then we went out with Sally and Trent to some event.  Sally was driving a truck.  I fell asleep after the event because I had been stoned and she crashed the truck.  She wanted to blame me for it but I didn't remember anything because I had been asleep.  There was going to be legal action and Trent and I were eating in a cafeteria.

They had a theme park dedicated to Middle-Earth and we were watching a documentary about the people who created it, sitting in the living room of 1377 with the morning light shining in.  Weathertop was the biggest seller, people went there carrying bags of donations.  They had all the different places marked. I thought it would be a fun idea to make a role playing game about the theme park, you would have different activities different colors and people would randomly attend the different activities and you would try to maximize attendance.  I was thinking about how to implement the long walk between weathertop and rivendell in a theme park.  Would you make people actually walk a long way?  Have concessons along the way to make money?  Shorten it and just pretend?  Have a 'nazgul' themed sky ride?

In the basement of the library, studying for an event like the PDD.  I had so many papers and notes and extra blank paper ready to take notes in the event.  Two laptops, books, backpack, etc.  I studied there overnight and then in the morning when it was time to move everything I couldn't carry it all at once.  So I took it in loads to the elevator.  Leaving it to get the next load I worried someone would take it.  I got everything to a hallway with chairs and curved desks.  I went to get the last stuff.  The place was filling up with students/attendees.  I couldn't find the way back.  I was so worried I had lost everything I didn't konw what to do.  I didn't have a cell phone or a wallet with me even.  I wandered around on the floor but couldn't find my way back.  Finally the crowds started to thin out and I found the hallway.  Mike Turnure was there selling donuts.  He had moved all my stuff to the side for me and had saved me 3 donuts, two plain and one frosted.  He explained that technically they were day old because they had just past the 24 hour mark, but really they were still perfectly good.

I was in the dentist.  The dentist was in a bus rolling down Snelling avenue south toward Summit.  The hygenist was taking my temperature.  She explained that they weren't using mercury in the thermometers anymore; they were using (something that sounded like propolyne glycol but had extra poppy sylables in it).  I said I thought they always had been.  She explained that it pitted your teeth and noticed that I had similar pitting.  She wondered if I had been exposed to it before.  I said I didn't think so.  She leaned in to investigate closer and this resulted in her kissing me full on the lips.  I didn't resist.  She wasn't moving her lips they were just pressed there.  My father objected and pinched my hand with some metal object.

We were taking the dog along the same rout.  The dog was happy.  The dog was in a harness.  The harness connected the dog to electrical and/or biological systems that we were going to test.  I jokingly said 'we only love you for your harness don't we' knowing he couldn't understand me.

At a presentation given by John Lennon.  I had a silly party ballon for his kid, which is how I got in.  Up the elevator.  A very young blonde lady was flirting with me.  They had some audience participation &#x2013; people pretended to be serving in a kitchen and then they overlaid projected animation on top of them.  There was a bunch of French stuff that Yoko did that I didn't understand.

Tennis game on Marshall avenue hill before the lake street bridge.  Mixed doubles.  The other people were much younger than us.  We switched sides to avoid having one team always facing the sun.  It was winter and there were patches of snow everywhere.  The balls were not really balls and we had to wrap cloth around them.  They didn't bounce very well.
</p>

<p>
We left and were upstairs of a coffee shop on Marshall ave.  I had to go fix something.  Someone had left all the tools, they were piled up in a room in the second floor of the coffee shop.  The room was the bathroom of 1377 and there were tools strewn everywhere like my dad's basement workshop of 1377.  I started organizing stuff.  I started putting stuff in the attic.  I needed to be sure that I didn't wake Babaka.  There was like a foot of insulation but I was able to get the board over it and put stuff away there anyway.  
</p>

<p>
I left for the repair job and I was worried that I had lost my backpack.  My cell phone and my wallet were in my backpack.  I went back inside the coffeeshop and Jimmy Turnure assured me that my backpack was still there.

We were lying around sleeping.  It was Thanksgiving.  Gayatri was lying next to me.  Gita came in and asked what we were going to do for dinner.  I said that I had no ability to help but might accommodate.  We were on a vacation for several days in a U. S. town and had forgotten that we would need to arrange dinner for Thanksgiving, that everything would be closed or already booked.  Gita said she found one place.  
</p>

<p>
Gayatri and I went to the grocery store.  There were long lines.  It was crowded and people were shoving by to get what they needed or bumping into us.  Someone wanted a big bag of dog food, so I grabbed it for them.  When I turned around to give it to them, both they and Gayatri were gone.  I started looking for her but couldn't see her.

I had a job and had to solve some deep computer problem.  It was out in the country.  I took the bus there.  There was a delay, so I went back to the hotel.  I had to urniate and air kept coming out.  Then so much water came out that I had to go into the bathtub.  Then I wanted to masturbate and there was a glossy magazine there.  I went outside because the light was better but there were too many people.  I almost got locked out without my shirt because I didn't have my key card but I managed to sneak in past some ladies who were inspecting.

At work.  All the people who were bucking for promotion were wearing hats.  Everyone was clapping by snapping fingers. I had no hat.  One of the junior administrators got promoted.  After the meeting it was 4:45 and I figured I'd go home early but a lot of other people were working.  I wasn't to go into the lab anymore.

<p>
Some piano sheet music that my father left me.  Schubert's Sherbet or Mozart's Mozzerlla or something like that.  It was a number of independent short pieces, stuck together.  Like a musical cartoon strip.  And they had a video for it.

Two planes arriving. I had to coordinate the delivery of the packages.  I took a cat &#x2013; who looked like my old cat Cthulu &#x2013; and went through the driving snow to the terminal where the other plane landed.  There I asked Brad Skillicorn if the packages had arrived and been delivered.  He assured me that they had.  But first I went to the cute girl, but she ignored me.

Walking through the library of the math department.  Carrying a bunch of books.  Looking at the books and understanding a little (line integral).  But only because of something that I investigated off-pieste.  I put the books down on the table and said 'There, consider that a divorce.'  And walked out.  The books got tangled up in the blanket I had wrapped about myself and I had to extricate it.  A train was coming and the train said 'This has got to end' over and over.

Carl was talking about some test thing as we went to a meeting.  I got the same feeling of not understanding things.  Brad Skillicorn walked past and said 'Ho Challenger' to the team he was working with, because they had NASA code names for their subteams.

<p>
I wasn't staying at 1377, I had a different place up north to go to.  It was a long way but I could take the Snelling bus for part of it.  I started walking there through the alleys.  They took a debit card which I had, but there was one corner where there were always quarters lying around so I took 3 in case I needed them to pay for the bus.

Sitting at a swimming pool.  The angle was very steep.  A kid asked me where sitting and standing heights were. He could only go sitting height because of some illness.  I showed him.  Nobody else was paying attention to him. Sitting was 1 meter out and standing was 3 meters.  The water was very clear and the sand was very fine.  If you threw some sand under the water you could see the cloud for a long way.  If you did it between your legs you could pretend it was farting.  I thought some crass people would find that very amusing.  I did it to the side and watched it come back around in the current.  When it came back around it was refined into a delicate snowflake.  There was also some cardboard junk.  I picked it up to through it away (and keep the snowflake) but I dropped the snowflake when I was trying to find the garbage can.
</p>

<p>
It was time to leave and I went to the picnic table where Sally and our 3 kids were eating and packing up.  I yelled at her, including the F word for leaving and not telling me.  She didn't even seem phazed.  She pointed out that there were 3 reasons why, one of them was that I was a known laptop user.  I knew what the other one was; it was my infideilty.  Not sure what the 3rd one is.  I helped her organize the coins in her purse and then left to get the bus to go to the airport.  Without telling them.
</p>

<p>
I accedentally took the 131 instead of the 111 and it just went in a circle.  The streets were unfamiliar and I kept thinking that it was good that I was doing a reccy of them and what I would say about leaving without informing (just like her) sure that she would be mad at me for doing it even though she had just done the same thing.  And I thought that even when I was being unfaithful I had given her the common human courtesy of telling her where I was.  I thought about saying all these things to her and winning the argument, even though I knew I never would.
</p>

<p>
I had a lot of different backpacks that I was trying to carry.  Somebody else got on the bus just as it was ending the circle and asked the bus driver which was how I found out I was on the wrong number.
</p>

<p>
I started walking back to the hotel where we were staying.  Someone walked alongside me and told me that if you ever got into an Uber that was a Vallencia(?) uber, you put the tax and exactly 4.68 and you would win a [diamond].  They were very posh.  I told him abou the time the mountain dew company would give you all of the cans from the vending machine if you put in the year they started.  He was unimpressed.

<p>
When I got back to the hotel, Sally's gun was there, suitably packed.  I started trying to get it ready to put in the luggage.

Was walking along through a middle-earth type land.  There were many lions.  I took a wooden block and hit one.  Then they were all mad at me.  I tried to run and went up to the top of the mountain and tried to fly to the next mountain range.  I was flying over a couple kingdoms and the king of one was a giant statue with outraised arms like antennae.  There was another king behind him farther away as well.  I wondered if he was frendly or not.  I flew over him and he started beaming at me to bring me down faster.  Not friendly.  I ended up landing in a warehouse/dock area.  But before I did I saw the whole city with all the details of the people walking in and out with their horses and families.
</p>

<p>
I went walking through the cafeteria at 5:00.  I was thinking it was late enough to leave, but others were there so I decided to go back upstairs.  I got all awkward in the hallway with some ladies, passing or going ahead.  The hallway was only enough to allow one person near the stairs. I went up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
I was in a room making coffee.  This was Cathy Wick's classroom on the 3rd floor except that it was a hotel room in an office building.  The person who was supposed to be staying there was sick and not using it.  So I went in there serruptitiously to make coffee for myself.  There were insects which were go pieces, some with rings around, some tied together in pairs.
</p>

<p>
The water was overflowing because I kept adding, so I pored some of it out the window, hoping that no one would notice.  Below the building &#x2013; which was Mechanics Arts &#x2013; was a waterfall anyway, so someone might mistake the water flowing down the side of the building for part of the waterfall; from a distance anyway.
</p>

<p>
Someone came in the other door because it was unlocked and I had to explain this whole thing to them.

We bought a guitar.  Over the phone with a credit card.  It was a custom job.  We went in to the store (which was in the Eagan strip mall).  There were other people picking up thier stringed instruments.  Ours wasn't there.  We asked after it and they said that they were probably still working on the head.  The guy went in back to find out.  There was a machine that did some gluing.  I followed him part of the way in the back but not all of the way because he went quickly around the corner and there were several other young people working there.  The back was quite spacious and open while the front was very crowded with equipment and customers; you could hardly get past people.

I took some caffiene pills from the vitamin jar; I was going to save them for work but I ate them right away.

Programming in a side cube by the window.  Nick Pelling was in the cube next to me.  He was explaining how code used to be thrown away every few seasons and so you could get away with errors but now code was meant to last years and decades so it had to be more rigorous.  I was telling myself that I was ready to accept that challenge.   A couple others gathered around.  The tools we were using were the full modelling tools.  Everything was very modern and there was a glass wall between me and the PC.

I decided to go to lunch.  There was a hallway out the back door and a convenience store there.  But they didn't have the power bar I wanted.  I went further along to the cafeteria.  The light from the windows on the right was very bright but the cafeteria was dark.  I needed to find a bathroom but I couldn't go to the one by the cafeteria because it was full for lunch.

I went to find the other one.  I followed the signs through a darkened hallway where an old lady security guard directed me.  The bathroom was next to the airport checkout at the 'little' terminal, where I had been before.

My father and I were in the car, mother was supposed to be coming out but she was late.  He got impatient and started moving the car back and forth.  I wondered if we were leaving without her or just getting ready.  The car was a boat and we went up a hill of water.  There were lots of rocks and weeds.  We saw another guy in a fishing boat with an outboard coming the other way.  We couldn't make it all the way up the hill so turned around and came back.  Father warned me not to drag my hands in the weeds.

We went into mothers apartment and asked for her.  She was still getting ready.  But Dan Smith was there and was asking about the best way to take notes for class.  I explained my whole clipboard and perfect binding to him.

As we left I stuffed a pipe and some pipe tobacco into my coat pocket.  It wouldn't fit in the little carrying case.  When we got home to the back room of 1377, which was filled with laundry and mattresses, Gayatri asked what was in my jacket pocket and I had to prevaricate and remove it, throughing it in the corner where hopefully she wouldn't notice.

The elevator lobby was very large, IDS-like.  There were many people pushing and shoving to get it.  I pushed the first button but then let the elevator go with others in it as I walked to the other end of the row of elevators to try to get one less crowded.

<p>
The elevators became trains and I was on the wrong side of the track when the train came so I had to wait for the next one.  I walked along and the train became a bus.  The other kids were waiting for the bus outside the convenience store up the hill. I had some pipe tobacco in my pocket and was having withdrawal symptoms.  I had to check my keys several times &#x2013; I had lost the other stuff I was carrying but I still had my car keys as I got into my fathers car which was parked beside the convenience store.

In a hotel which was a bookstore.  I had a bunch of giant transparencies which were pornographic and I was worried that the cleaning ladies would be finding them when I was not there.  I needed to clean them all up before I left and they were all mixed in with some albums.  I left the albums out, some of which were racy, to try to show that my pornography was no worse.

<p>
We were in a bookstore which was a library which was the auditorium of the school.  There were computers on each of the desks in the auditorium and people were using them.  John Alstrop was with me.  I booted up my new PC and logged into my bank, then left it, thinking no one would touch it.  When I came back, there was a note that my bank account was frozen and that I had bought too much furniture.  I assumed it was a scam from a faux furniture company that had locked my PC with ransom ware.  I was so afraid of what Gayatri would say.  After running around and looking at some of the sci fi books, Gayatri came back and I explained this to her and she was affectionate and reassured me, explaining that this always happens here, it'll go away once we leave.
</p>

<p>
I was at work and it was in the cafeteria.  I used to have an office of my own but they rearranged everything.  There was a little lab with flowers, plants, growlights. It was like the math room in Mechanic Arts but much smaller.  I had spent a lot of time in there, but someone else was in there now so I went looking for a different place to sit.  Out in the tables in the library like area.  
</p>

<p>
In the cafeteria finishing lunch, I had been throwing cut up paper into the pot of one of the larger plants and I hadn't been able to remove all of it.  Someone observed this as they watered it.  I tried to make excuses and skim the remainder off the top.  I got most of it.  Some large boxes were being thrown away instead of recycled.  I saw this and started ripping them into smaller pieces so that they could be recycled.  As I did this and put other stuff in the recycling, I realized that I had been recycling metal utinsels from the cafeteria that could be reused.  The guy sitting next to me explained this.
</p>

<p>
I started to worry if the plants in the lab were getting enough water and made a point of going in first thing monday to water them.  I asked the person who was in there but he said he hadn't already watered them.  There was one that he had next to a running tap, so I gave it just 2 drops.  He said it didn't need much and I said I hadn't given it much.

There, at the foot of a stairway, he told us about the various criminal undercurrents that were involved.  The Oil and Gas industry had a large stake in it.

We were at sea in a small ship going against a larger ship.  There was magic involved so if you cast the spell right you would be flying in the moon's gravity and could fall a significant way without getting hurt.  I sharpened a dagger extra sharp.  It was the story that I had to defeat the main enemy by using the dagger left-handed along with my main sword.  We went running around trying to find some advantage.  The ship could have been a nice estate from the early 19th century. I looked at the score.  They were at nearly 600 and we were just above 300.  We had to find some way to bring it closer.  I started throwing some of their stuff overboard.  A big lamp.  That started to bring them down closer to 400.  He enemy's duke came after me.  I threw pickled peppers from a barrell at him and that distracted him long enough for me to stab him.  At this time I was confused about which of my blades was the main one, the special dagger and the inferior one.

Professor Roberts was giving a lecture, except it was a spiritual lecture, not about math.  He didn't actual say 'God' but there were clear religious overtones.

There was a water cooler in the back and it gave out the best cool water; just above freezing.  It was 2 cents but somebody had put in 20 cents and left the change there so you could just use that.  I had a hard time finding a clean paper cup.  The secretaries were coming in to refill the cold water.

We were going up some steep narrow stairs on the right side of the building.  It was a whole bunch of business people.  There were two girls and one of them left.  I started to feel very self conscious that they would think I was only interested in the girls and not the work.  Which was somewhat true.  Or true on some level.

<p>
When we got to the top there was a banner commemorating one of the company's successes.  It was attributed to 'NN Philly' and I was like 'Gayatri, why did you put my name there?' but then I realized it was from the 70's and so it really was just someone with that name.  Prasad also had credit from when he was a junior engineer.

It was a remake of star wars starting over with a different introduction.  The pilot, who was the dark-side version of Luke Skywalker was featured.  One of the female troops on the ship asked why such a high ranking officer suddenly had a need to take this trip.  She looked straight into his eyes as if not expecting reprimand for being impertinent.  He looked back at her knowing he was unable to deny that it was a secret mission of great importance to the dark side.  The pilot guided the ship down to the planet.

I was on the edge of a park and there were many benches and trash cans etc.  And each of them had an edge and from any given edge the enemy might be hiding and I had to defend myself against them all.

I tried to find my cubicle &#x2013; it was at JCI but it was also the math grad school.  It was #207.  They had rearranged everything and all the cubicles and offices were moved around and updated.  I went looking for a place.  They had a lot of new people in the library and they were adding digital media.  I finally gave up and was going to walk through the door when I looked to my left and there was a narrow staircase going way up.  It was supposed to remind me of my high school.  It was carpeted with rainbow patterns.

We went to the afterlife.  The person who was introducing us there explained that there had been some cuts.  So whereas if you had been good and might expect your own fancy restaurant in the afterlife, now all you would get was a pizza stand.  And those who were worse?  Well&#x2026;  Then the delivery of ingredients came by after dropping off for the pizza stand.  There were 3 sections in the truck, the outer ones were lighter and the inner one was a drab purple.  It was full of onions.
</p>

<p>
Oh, my god!  You made them the onions!  How could you make a deal like that?  Well&#x2026;  Ok that does it, I'm taking over.  Take me to the coordinator.  I grabbed him by the arms.  No, I can't do that.  Don't worry, I'll cut you a deal?  Really?  Yeah, if you'll take me to the coordinator.  How can you do that, how much of this place do you own?  All of it.

Professor Konhauser left for a good part of the class.

The next day I was sure to have blank pages to take notes on.  I sat over in the corner next to the coat rack.  There was one girl in the corner and I felt embaressed next to her.

I was near Ayd Mill Road and Hamline.  I had to get to my CCB meeting at 10:00 and I was late for work.  It was a little after 9:30.  I tried to call Mariela to ask her to run it.  I remembered the number.  Brad Skillicorn ended up answering.  It was a phone I had lent him.  He was perfectly normal about it and was explaining the work that he was doing.  
</p>

<p>
I pushed past the other people at the bus stop and called an Uber.  I was now able to make it to the meeting &#x2013; at Linwood &#x2013; on time or about on time.  The driver started going through some industrial roads near the riverfront that I had not been on before.  I wondered if this was really the way there.  He assured me that it was.  
</p>

<p>
Eventually it turned out that it wasn't and he dropped me at a restaurant.  There were a bunch of kids there eating pizza.  I insisted on getting a bus for myself and all the other people in the restarant to get to the right place.  And the bus had to be driven by doctor who.  Finally someone dressed as the sixth doctor, driving the bus, came in and started an argument with the fifth doctor who was in the restaurant.  Then bus driver dressed as the sixth doctor led us outside to the parking ramp.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the parking ramp children including Dan Smith were playing ball in a park covered with bushes.  The park actually was the treetops which were so dense you could walk on them.  People were resistant to playing.  I kicked the ball and it came back to me.  Then someone kicked it and it went all the way to the edge and fell over the side.  I went to look for it but it had fallen all the way off the tree cliff, infinitely far.  They told me to look again and I went down a rope through the trees.  It turned out that actually it didn't go infinitely far down.  There was a floor of a shopping mall just beneath the trees.  I got the ball back and then went walking along the floor of the shopping mall.  
</p>

<p>
I went up an elevator to the third floor of the shopping mall.  It was an open elevator.  As I went up there were the people who were responsible for the production, including the author who was a little girl, elementary school aged, with a microphone.  I thanked her for her work as I went up past her.

Just then someone came down and asked me what I was doing.  I pretended that I was one of the inspectors.  We went back up to the surface and I was making up all kinds of things in response to their questions.  When we got to the top, the theatre owner asked when we had gotten our shots, because there was a long list of diseases that you could get from being down there.  The other guy of course had actually had them and I just made something up about last Wednesday.  As I left I heard them asking each other who I was.  Just some guy pretending.

I was designing a D&amp;D game, except we were really running around in the dungeon.  The idea was that there were two undead.  They could only be affected my magic weapons, which did 1/2 damage and the regenerated completely so you had to kill them in one hit.  But when you did, they didn't die, they just retreated back to their post, which they could no longer move from and then magic weapons did full damage.  So really you had to kill them 3 times over; twice outside their base and then one in the base.  You couldn't bring magic weapons into the dungeon; you had to find them there.

My father was making me git rid of my other car.  We were in the living room of 1377 and I was wondering how I was going to carry large deliveries afterward.  I was thinking of a scheme where I buy fruit, juice it and have it bottled then sell to local stores.

I went along to another room and finally found the piano bench so I sat down there, thinking it was mine anyway so why not.  It was in the dining room of 1377 and there was a couch next to it.  Somebody got up from the couch leaving it empty when I sat down on the piano bench.  The couch was very Queen Anne with plush cushions.

Playing a song on the guitar at Uncle Davids.  Lots of modulation and it just kept going up the scale.  But no one was listening to me, they were listening to John Banks on the piano.  I almost threw the guitar out the back door.

You know that you are not going to finish your thesis when you start wondering if you need to start looking into a separate subject.  I was sitting on a bunk bed in a dormitory, reading a statistics book instead of a math book. There was a young lady student on a bed kitty corner from me.
</p>

<p>
I was resarching something for my boss.  This involved listening to all songs on multple channels.  I had my headphones on and was diligently listening to each of them under the name of research, but I wasn't taking notes. This was done sitting in front of a television (old style picture tube) on a picnic bench on a boulevard that had some modern restaurants in south Minneapolis.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about how many cars there were compared to busses.  Near Grand and Dale.  People would think everyone drives instead of taking public transport. And you see cars parked on the street that aren't actually used by anyone but you never see the busses parked so you think there are more cars than busses. Started counting the people going by on the buses and realized that everytime you see a bus go by you need to assume that it is a full block of traffic.  Got on the bus and had a seat of my own.  I was continuing to listen to the songs from before on a walkman.  It was supposed to be the band Yes but they had a slight reggae sound and were doing covers.
</p>

<p>
A bus passed us and left many people off at the corner of Grand &amp; Dale,  Then when we stopped there many people got on. I moved my backpack onto my lap in case someone wanted to sit there but no one did.  I was about the only empty seat in the bus.
</p>

<p>
Then we all had to get off and we were taking grocery carts through a small convenience store in a shopping mall because it was lunch time.  I had a lot of toilet paper in my shopping cart that I had gotten from other places.  I had gotten friends to pay the store for them so I didn't owe the store but I still owed the friends.  I was wondering how this store was going to keep them apart.  I organized them in the shopping cart.  Moving all the loose toilet paper rolls over to one side.  Some mis matched bottles of coke and some other stuff.

<p>
I let everyone else go in front of me because they were all on lunch break and had to get back but I wasn't.  There was quite a line and we were hardly moving.

I was standing in front of the mirror in the dining room of 1377.  I had a terrible pimple, which I burst.  It left a gaping hole and you could see the flesh a full inch inside.  I thought I should put a bandaid over it to avoid dirt getting in there.  I went off to work and I had to get in various rooms.  They were like waiting rooms.  The cielings were very high and the hallway was curved.  Everything was monumental concrete.  What are you going to do to match the flashiness of the Indians?  I went into one of the rooms to grab a vase.  Then I thought that was a silly idea. 
</p>

<p>
I went out to the parking lot.  I was wondering if I had forgotten something.  I didn't have my backpack with me.  I was flying freely through the area; no one was around.  There was a dead end so I turned around and went up.  I had to get through a membrane to get into the shopping mall type area where all the people were.  It was difficult to get through.  I wondered if this was what the birth experience was like.
</p>

<p>
It was the end of the day on Sunday.  Gayatri and I were in our separate offices.  She asked me 3 times if I had done the vacuming.  I was like no; if you wanted it done you should have asked before.  She was like you can't just ignore your duties.  I was like all right then put everything you want done on a list and I'll do it at the time I feel right.  And dont complain if then I don't have time to do anything fun you want to do.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c0496b">
<p>
It was northern Minnesota, near Duluth.  There was some snow coming and we weren't supposed to be travelling but we were.  We were in a large van.  A family in front of us had a small car.  Their kid lost a stuffed animal in the snow and I went to pick it up for them.
</p>

<p>
We got in a van with all our suitcases.  I was crushed up right behind the driver.  He had a lit cigarette.  Finally I couldn't take it any more and told him to put it out.  How can you have that thing inside the car?  When he didn't, I started to hold my hands over his mouth.  How do you like not being able to breathe?  This caused him to veer all over the road, crashing through fences and nearly running a worker over.  When the van finally stopped, I got out, said I just want my stuff, took my suitcase and backpack and started to walk northwest into the forest.  Some of the other female passengers walked straight west along the road.

<p>
At a dinner with my mother.  There were two waitresses.  And they brought the first course of the order, vegetarian for me.  There would usually be wine, but she said that she had stopped completely.  The other lady at the table with us (blonde) didn't want any and the brunette ordered a beer from her homeland.  I forgot she did and didn't want to be the only one at the table so i ordered diet coke.  
</p>

<p>
Then there were 5 of us there; the brunette had split in 2.  I made a point of explaining that I didn't realize that she was drinking and thats why I didn't order a beer.
</p>

<p>
Now the exciting part of this is that I had made love to her in a hotel room the night before and we were trying not to reveal that fact.  Although she was saying things that were almost hints.
</p>

<p>
After that I was walking through the neighborhood on Stanford south of Snelling.  Going to someone's house but I hadn't arranged it.  Through parks and playgrounds that aren't there in reality.
</p>

<p>
Flying through open cavernous parking ramps.  Up the top of a hill in a forest with trees.  A special walking stick for grabbing things would also let you fly for a ways.  Accross puddles where there was some lizard-like monster.

<h3 id="orgae94472">Changing the Wiring in the Basement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgae94472">
<p>
We had to change the wiring in the basement so that we could have new lights.  We had re-wired the basement before and there were detailed instructions involving 2 long plastic bags of green wiring and various clamps and screws.  These had to be connected to the right places in various locations in the L shaped basement.  We got a whole bunch of people to help us.  I started to open up the bags, read the instructions and get the equipment sorted out and prepare the locations.  We had done it before so we should be able to do it again.  It was confusing where everything was and what order things should be done in.  
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I realized that all this wiring was for the other end, betwen the outlet and the fuse.  Just to put new lights in was wiring up to the outlet. So we didn't have to do any of that.  Emergency over.
</p>

<p>
I was standing in a room off the main area of the basement.  There was a big workbench there like a hut.  We had invited the whole public to come in and see the work.  A couple came by.  The guy was really big.  Football player type.  He mumbled something I couldn't understand.  I asked him again.  Still couldn't understand. Again.  "I'll have a bud light.  Might as well while waiting for this thing to start."  I had to explain to him that we didn't serve refreshments.  "Well maybe you should."  He walked away and I wondered why we had invited the public as if it was a convention.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaec67b1">
<p>
I went over to the far corner of the L shaped basement where it was more like a fair and a stand was selling tea and buscuits.  They were also selling dog food.  Well not really; their branding was that they were the dog food farm and they were here for a demo of their product but they were selling tea.  The stand was on the side of a steep steep hill and all down the side of the hill were patches of different kinds of dog food with dogs rooting about in it.  I asked some questions because Bob and Marie had said they were in need of some dog food and I wondered if I could ship them bulk on a train.  I left and then came back and asked further about prices.  She showed me the chart on the wall in the back room.  $59/lb.

<h3 id="orgd0c743b">Mediaeval Courtyard</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd0c743b">
<p>
I had to go to the bathroom and there was a mediaval courtyard where all the privies were.  They were segregated by country, so I had to go into the one for Americans, not the one for French.  There were two for americans &#x2013; one for regular americans and one for those who dribbled when they urinated.  I was happy to get the one for those who dribbled even though they both had seats and not urinals.  I had earlier been able to go into the one in the corner but now it had a sign on it 'For Holy People Only' and when I started to go there the floorboards tripped me up so I didn't go in.
</p>

<p>
Then my friends came.  It was a D&amp;D game.  They were planning an ambush.  Two of them were chasing 9 cavalry and a wizard or two.  The rest were after the 30 or so infantry in a different location.  They were planning to force them all together at a point.  As a prince in the story, I felt a premonition that I would die in the battle.  I was very excited about this and started to prepare.

</p>

<p>
I went into the meeting room ready to explain this.  But then they explained that the chip manufacturer had guaranteed forward compatability &#x2013; it was with the 999 chip which was a little more expensive, but that would be acceptable.

I was in an auditorium, taking a math test.  There were signs all around the auditorium, like ( 11 II ii ll 22 jj )  and we were supposed to find a cycle like (1 I i) -&gt; 1 so (11 II ii) is a cycle.  But when I tried to answer the question it didn't quite work out and the questions just went deeper and deeper and I didn't understand.  The paper was large thick art paper.
</p>

<p>
So I went to find a place to study but everywhere was busy.  X was there in the hallway asking questions.  I saw a sign that said not an exit, exit next door but I tried it anyway and ended up in some offices with desks.  Students were doing some routine work study and office work.
</p>

<p>
Then I was in a hallway with a computer and we were supposed to be working on a GDT problem for TK.  I wanted my colleague to do some awk parsing on a file.  But actually the file wasn't in the format I thought.  It didn't give all information about all GDT, just the differences between those in different versions of firmware.  Then my colleague got up and said this is what we are going to be working on this week.  I got concerned that I only had a contract and not a permanent job.  I thought that I had better get a clearer picture of the requirements and a better report on my progress.

I asked her what she needed and it was just some of the redistributible files, so I said that I would share those with her.

I pushed every pedal &#x2013; gas, brake, clutch &#x2013; but it would not stop going backwards in a circle.  There were children on bikes around and I was afraid I would hit them.  I tried to put it in low gear but that didn't work.  I thought that the car would back into a wall or some trees but it never did.  It just went faster and faster.  Eventually I realized that if it hadn't already hit something it wasn't going to and relaxed.

Just as everyone was going out, I realized that I had forgotten it.  So I went back to get it.  Then I was in the tail of the crowd instead of the head.  Everyone was very eager to go.

<p>
Past a train, down into a pallet garden.  I started destroying the enemy farms and capturing their food.  It was unclear which side any given item belonged to but I just kept going and it seemed like the right thing to do.

I was packing up to drive home with my grandma.  She was driving and she was so anxious to get home that she started hitting things in the road.  First logs, then dogs.  When she was about to run over a person on the offramp, we had to slow her down and take the car from her.  Then we were all sitting around and Dennis was smoking.

I was in a typing contest with my boss.  He put some text in a table and then I started to be more expository about it.  The typewriter was mechanical but it was connected to the university computers.  
</p>

<p>
My text started out OK but soon started to get garbled as the backspace wouldn't work.  Then when you took the sheet out of the typerwriter everything was crossed out.  But the idea was good.

<p>
We were in the living room of 1377, me, Gayatri and some other people.  Gayatri was asking for something and I started yelling at her.  She didn't react and none of the others even noticed.  Finally I got what she wanted, which was a water bottle from accross the room.  I yelled at her, why don't you just go over and get it yourself.  While handing it to her.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org364f5c3">
<p>
We went to a Star Wars show. Then I went again but the time before was the last day.  I just walked into the same queue expecting the same show to be playing but it wasn't.  It was a circus type thing for kids.  The guy pretended to hand me a bag of christmas toys as I passed in.  They were handing these to all the kids.  He smiled; obviously it wasn't for me.  
</p>

<p>
I left the line and went to find where the show was actually playing.  But it wasn't playing anymore; that had been the last day of its run.  I wandered around the mall a little to see if there was anything else interesting to do.  There were a lot of other science fiction shows playing but I didn't know which ones were good.  I went to the bookstore and they had a big display with a bunch of new video games in TV screens showing to the people in the hall from the glass wall of the store.  I thought about if any of them would be interesting.  They were all variations of a 2d space game that I had played a very early copy of long ago.  I moved on.
</p>

<p>
I was outside.  Near Ayd Mill road.  I called Trent to see if he wanted to get some pie or something.  I had been going to invite him to the movie (this was Gayatri's suggestion) but now of course the movie wasn't playing.  He said he had just been eating.  It was some desert that he had made using a variation of Grape Nuts.  One that had lots of fibers &#x2013; in the sense that it was a feathery variant of Grape Nuts, not in the sense that it had lots of fibre in it.  I said that was funny because I had just bought some Grape Nuts.  We awkwardly said goodbye and I wandered down the road in a dirty Minnesota winter.

We were sitting in a library.  One of us was a lawyer and was explaining that they had 365 days of vacation remaining.  Then they were going to resign.  But there was one meeting in the middle of her next year of vacation that her company insisted that she attend.  And it was in the middle of the night her time.  I said that was funny.  You could just call in and say you don't know why you are there and be done.
</p>

<p>
She explained that her company had lots of rigourous rules.  Like you had to use a certain kind of eraser.  I asked if that met six sigma.  The younger lady sitting accross the table said that it did not.  I was pleased with myself for giving her a victory in the conversation.  I said that according to six sigma if you wanted to prescribe something you should require the result not the method.  So in this case, you should say that you wanted documents to be erased completely.  Not dictate the tool used for that.  Then the employees would have the freedom to find a better solution.
</p>

<p>
We were concerned about the upcoming vote.  It would, again, center on facilities upkeep.  The area that we were in was actually very nice and modern but half the company still had to deal with the old building which was run down and leaked.  I thought that the problem would be solved if we could just set up cubiles in the factory space but that was against union regulations.

<p>
I got tired of sitting at the table in the library and decided that the best thing to do was to go into work and work on the long calculation I was doing.  This wasn't a thing that really needed to be done, it was kind of a background task, but it was one that was interesting from a technical perspective (irl:  the mks port).  
</p>

<p>
To get into work was a video game.  It was one I had played before and I was quite good at it.  But it was a new version of the game, so I had to start over as level one.  
</p>

<p>
I still had my rock/brute-force power so I was able to get through the door that previously had been open but which was now too small for me by battering it repeatedly.  It changed form each time as video games do.  All clown-like animated faces in unrealistic imaginary colors.  
</p>

<p>
Once I got in I needed to get up to the appropriate floor.  There were rail lines running everywhere and people walking around like proper British gentlemen.  With hat and umbrella.  Now you had to pay to use the line and there was no way I could do that.  But I still had my roll/wheel power so I was able to travel the lines myself, even uphill or upside down.  I worried about how I was going to get out on the other side without being able to prove that I had paid.  
</p>

<p>
When I finally got in to the office, I had to manoeuvre my trolly with my computer past the cleaning lady and then through the portal into the work area.

I was wiping my bottom after going to the bathroom.  I had to do this over and over again because it never came clean but I was determined to finish the job.  I was in an office in a hallway in a university because that was where the only bathrooms were. 
</p>

<p>
First it was a classroom and a guy was having an intelligent debate on some subject.  Then it was an office and there was a lady who needed to store her bicycle in it.  First her and a young child poked their heads in.  I asked their names.  I should have known their names.  The young child had a name that sounded like 'ugly' and she joked that that was her name.  But it was hard to pronounce and I slurred it.  I shouted out to the rest of the hall that they were being sinister.  But the lady had to store her bike there, it was her office.  I apologized that I had to use the bathroom in her office but it was the only option.  She was understanding.
</p>

<p>
Then I was in Clayton's dorm room.  He had a small single room and it was him, a lady (blonde and heavy boned) and their children.  They were playing a game involving spinning toys in water.  It was very relaxing and she commented on the fact.  Then I had to leave.  They had their backs to me but I patted them on the back in parting in lieu of a hug.
</p>

<p>
I had to find the bathroom.  It was, as they explained to me, down the hall and to the right.  That was why they didn't like living there.  It was very crowded in the morning with all the other people and the breakfast crowd so sometimes they skipped it.  
</p>

<p>
I went down the hall and there was a guard &#x2013; a middle aged lady with short brown hair &#x2013;  there sitting halfway down the stairss and a velvet cord over the stairs.  I was worried that I had to show my membership badge.  I had a guest pass from visiting Clayton but was concerned that I wouldn't be able to find it.  She said that I could just step over the cord on the steps.  I didn't have to show my badge.  Maybe she was only there for people coming the other way, because the downstair area exited into the open.
</p>

<p>
In the basement was a big hall.  All decorated in wood.  This was Macalester of course.  I looked around and realized that I had been there before.  Maybe for a dance or maybe for graduation.  I expected the restrooms to be easy to find but of course they weren't.  I tried to follow the signs and ended up outside.  It was an area like a fair with lots of concession stands.  It was  covered with netting.  I still needed to get out past the netting.  
</p>

<p>
It was now in the southwest corner of Snelling &amp; St. Clair, in a big pit.  I needed to climb to street level.  First there was a water obstacle.  I was swining from branches above a swampy area where people were eating at a fashionable restaurant.  Then there was a sand obsticle.  You had to climb the sand hill at an angle or you would slide back.  And there were people sitting at the top. 
</p>

<p>
At the end the street was a more residential version of Macalester street leading to St. Clair, with trees and gates.  I thought to myself I'll never find the way to this place again.

Bought an ice cream at the gas station and paid for it with my card.  When we got where we were going I realized that I didn't have my card.  I had a bunch of other identity cards that were non-standard and oversized.  My ex-wife was there and she wanted to search though a bunch of trash in the hall first before checking the gas station we had just left whereas I wanted to check the gas station first.  We got into an argument and I threw milk on her and stormed off.  At this point I had to be right about the gas station and I hated having to prove myself instead of having a reasonable discussion about the options.
</p>

<p>
When I got to the gas station, the lady there did have my credit card.  And a whole bunch of the oversize cards.  But she wouldn't let me have my credit card back without proof of identity and my only proof of identity was the credit card.  All the other oversize cards I had had other people's names on them.  My ex-wife came there and she was no longer mad at me but her vouching for me wasn't enough for the gas station lady so we had to &#x2013; go on a quest:
</p>

<p>
We had to find the |Toad King| who was in a department store.  In order to get to him we had to get something for someone else.
</p>

<p>
It was the last day at graduate school and I was leaving.  I went in to pick up my stuff.  I had a stuffed animal snake that I had taken from a classroom in my backpack.  The people I saw there on the last day had nothing to do with who I hung out with during my time there.  I had no attachment to them and no expectation to see them again.  The one guy regarded me favorably.
</p>

<p>
We had to get through the magic door, which was in a well, near the top.  Near the Lake Street bridge by the Mississippi.  I climed down the well and filled up the water in the well by breaking up the rocks.  Then you could stand to reach the door.  At that point my band of |dwarves?| could go in and break down the door with brute force. Which they did.  We could then go in and take the treasure.  They spent a lot of time picking over the treasure and I was worried that we would run out of time.

Running a CCB for a mixed HW/SW project.  Couldn't get the projector running, so I went back to taking paper notes.  Which turned out to be a good thing, because I got a lot of answers from the different hardware teams about why they were late and what the risks were.  They showed me their different physical models and explained the integration concerns.  There was a junior team that was doing one of the mechanical pieces and a senior team that was doing the enclosure.  The project hadn't met any milestones because the project manager was on maternity leave.
</p>

<p>
They decided to show me the model they were holding back.  It involved going outside and digging under the frozen ground.  I started walking along the wood sidewalk but there were glass shards, so I had to go in because I was barefoot.  They said they had socks. The socks were wolf skins.  They didn't completely cover my feet but I wore them anyway.  There was also a frozen wolf who was very happy to have me hold them in my arms.

I kept wanting to go back to the place by Jon Tromp's that was my home except it was really Normas.  I had a room there.

I was driving a car.  It was old and I wasn't sure how much gas it had left, but it was my car and I was driving it.  Old country roads.  There was snow on them.  If you were walking you had to go from the overpass to the trains that went by underneath.  A lady complained about this.  I told her that all the big cities like New York or San Francisco had the same thing where you would have to go from above to below.  That seemed to placate her.

The road, which was dusty with snow, went up the highway bridge over the train tracks.  It then devolved into twisting forest paths.  The car was the same but it was a bicycle or walking.

We were at a large dinner, white tablecloths set over row tables with benches.  Each of the moms had 2 circular slabs of putty on thier collar, which they could take off.  They were labeled '2 for <del>L</del> 3'.  Some of the moms were giving just one to their kids.  I asked what they were, if they were uppers or downers.  I didn't get a clear answer. They said that you would feel like you were spinning around and around and the whole world was spinning around and around.  I said, "Ah, so they are hallucinogens."  Trying to sound knowlegable.  I don't know if it worked.  Nor am I sure that being knowlegable about hallucinogens is a quality you want to broadcast.

<p>
Dan Smith was there and he asked why I wasn't happy.  He was quite adamant about it, almost angry.  I had good food, a wonderful lifestyle.  Just look at this banquet we were sitting at.  How could I explain to him that I had no money, no place to live of my own, was failing in school, didn't know where my next meal would come from or where my next place to sleep would be?

We were at Leo Abbott's, or perhaps it was Paul Abbott's.  We had been staying there and we were going to be leaving, taking our suitcases to our own place.  We were being lackadaisical about leaving on time but there wasn't a lot of pressure.  We started packing up some of the stuff.  I was packing very loosely based on the assumption that we would be making two trips.  This is a continuation of the fact that I had my own car now and could drive on the snowy city streets through downtown.  But Gayatri pointed out that we were going to try to make only one trip, so I needed to pack more compactly.  I got some extra bags from Paul which was just what I needed. I started to put my stuff from the corner/attic room in them and realized that I had a lot more than I originally thought.  Looks of books, but also trophies and other tall mechanical items that I was trying to fit loosely in a bag that was similar to the roller shopping basket we have.

We were following someone down a hallway.  Except that the hallway had lots of hidden, secret doors.  Like Dr. Who's telephone box.  Gayatri and I started following the leads.  At first they were just that there was a false end with an optical illusion and you didn't see the turn in the corridor until you were there.  But then they became more difficult.  There was a door in the side wall that they handle looked like a normal outcropping of the rock.  Everything was creamy white and black wavy lines like a 3d model of hills in a panorama.  I started going on my own when I opened the door.  I had to push an area of the wall for it to open and the way went down deeper and became more caustrophobic

I called in to JCI even though I didn't work there anymore.  I was wondering what they were wanting me for.  They talked about the project and hiring.  I was wondering who was taking over the hiring.  They said that they thought that it was Derek.  I supposed that that was reasonable.  One of the junior team members on the phone said that he wasn't getting his questions answered.  This was after we spent the whole meeting talking about other things.  I thought maybe you could have asked the questions during our meeting?
</p>

<p>
I was looking at my notebook.  I now had nothing to write in about my thesis.  And nothing for the work because no work.  I didn't know what to write.  It was a blank sheet of paper.  I was on a page where there was the headline for a meeting with professor Roberts.  There weren't any notes from it so the rest of the page was blank.

I was on a bus.  Travelling over the Ayd Mill road on St. Clair.  I was trying to use a pencil and some funny art marker, but I got the black from the art marker all over my clothes and my backpack.  I thought this is why we can't have nice things.

The hallway is sort of the hallway with the labs at Thermo King.  Lots of people go there to lunch though.  Prasad's office is in the middle of the hallway.  He was standing behind his desk and Gayatri was standing next to him.  They were discussing some strategic business thing.  I said, see?  He is not even interested in talking to me.  No wonder I couldn't get things done, even when he has stuff to tell the team he goes around me.  When did it start?  He said it started when you took responsibility for the marine project.  It was too technical and would have taken too much of your time.

Teaching a history class with Tony Dunlop.  He felt that history was best taught by stories.  We would have the students read a bunch of stories, and then we would call on them randomly to recite the story.  So they would have to have read them all because they wouldn't know which they would be picked on to recite.

Class was only once per week.  It was in a room that was like it was on the ground floor of Linwood.  I insisted on counting the number of weeks in the class between the tests.

We chose a selection of stories.  I was worried they weren't enough especially if there were more students.  Because then some students would be called on to recite stories that others had already given which would be an unfair advantage.  But we had them.  And I wasn't going to argue.  
</p>

<p>
All the students were there on the first day.  Tony seemed reluctant to start.  So I did. I have him credit for the idea.  Then he took over.  This allowed me to lie down on the floor and rest.

<h3 id="org267e7ef">Up the hill on the bus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org267e7ef">
<p>
My colleague and I were talking the bus.  The number 21A down Snelling and turning on St. Clair.  He got on the bus at the northwest corner of the intersection, on Snelling.  I had to catch it on the southeast corner off St. Clair.  I ran over there by the bakeries and other stores that never stayed in business very long.
</p>

<p>
Except then I was on the bus and I needed to get off so that I could meet my friend who was on the other bus.  I rang the bell, expecting the driver to stop but he didn't.  I waiting paitently past three stops.  Apparently he didn't stop unless someone actually stood up.  I wanted to insist on doing things my way and he should just have realized that that was the way things are done.  
</p>

<p>
When we got to the top of the hill it was a big stop and a lot of people got off so I got off with them.  The hill kept going up and up past concrete bridges and overpasses.  I had to get to the other bus stop which was on one of the higher bridges.  I wasn't sure I would make it because there were so many different places, parks, restaurants, resorts, all on the way there as well.
</p>

<p>
I started up, and I tried to look at the map on my phone but it didn't tell me much.  I just started guessing and going up, hoping that I would find it but being pessimistic that I wouldn't.  There was snow.  Everything was colored as if animated.  My phone showed some people having a snowball fight.  That was where he was.  I made it there.  Between some apartment buildings on the lawn in front.  I met him and started going up further through the stairs between the apartment buildings.

There were many people around an old concrete parking ramp.  Like a school outing.  We were in groups of 4 and had to defeat the others, like paintball.  For some reason the 4th person didn't matter, but I had to defeat Mike Turnure and Jack Riebel.  It was also vitally important &#x2013; fated &#x2013; that I do so for strategic reasons.  They got me a couple of times but they were close calls so I kept on going.  Then they used a machine gun as I was flying by but I held up my shield, which was a black rectangular box, and it didn't have marks on it so again I declared it a miss and kept going even though I felt like a bad sport for doing so.  
</p>

<p>
Finally as everyone was gathering to leave, I snuck to where they were and got them, declaring my victory.

We were supposed to answer a questionnaire about what we thought about high school and what we were going to do afterwards.  Each of the answers were supposed to be a single word.  Eventually it wore down to just one word and that had to be scratched on the back of a piece of metal that was about the size of  ruler but shorter, maybe 8 inches.  I was afraid that I had said too much about my high school crush so I went back to change it before it was reviewed.  This involved hanging from a cliff ceiling.  A walkway went over the top of the cliff.  Fortunately I had already blacked out my answer with marker or some other black art product.  This meant that it would be difficult to write a new answer over it.

On west 7th near the civic center.

Meh was the specific word I used.  This was in way of apologizing for the fact that I had no money and the money I had spent on christmas trees.   This involved hanging by a rope and swinging out over the emptied out basement of a construction area on the southwest corner.

I was in my room, which was an apartment in the north.  I had no money left to pay the rent for the next month.  I was in school and I was barely getting by on grades and my part time job wouldn't pay the bills.  If I got a full time job I would surely fail my classes because no time and energy left to study.
</p>

<p>
I was lying on the bed and looking at the kitchen.  All the fun food had been eaten up but my mother had left a large number of vegetable.  I didn't feel like cooking but thought maybe I could make a salad.  The sun was poring in the window.

I went outside to the gas station at the end of the road where the apartment building was.  There I saw Dennis giving Trent some change.  Then Trent turned around and left, walking along the main road to the highway overpass.  
</p>

<p>
I asked Dennis if he always saw Trent this way.  He said yes, every Thursday and 9 PM, its our thing.  Trent took the bus to the previous on ramp of the highway and then had to walk the remaining distance but was happy to do so to see Dennis.  
</p>

<p>
I vacillated, but eventually decided to tell my father about my  financial problems and how the apartment I was in I could only afford if I had a full time job.  He said it might just work if all three of us move in.  I wasn't sure how Gayatri would feel about that.
</p>

<p>
As I was walking back to the apartment I was thinking what job I could get.  And then I realized.  I had to look for a job in the library.

During the break, I snuck in to the room where they kept the old newspapers and started to look through the want ads for jobs about the library.  I was thinking that I could explain about my experience in work-study in college.  I tried to be careful so that people wouldn't realize that I had been looking at the employment ads while at work.  But the newspapers, under the shelves, got all messed up anyway and didn't really look like they had started when I put them back.  A D&amp;D game on a quest for marshmallows?
</p>

<p>
Then I was in the dungeon of 1377 with one lady co-worker and an old radio.  Prasad was on the radio, asking if we could get the next release.  I told him a minimal release.  He started asking about enhanced features and if we didn't release them now would we ever release them.  An academic discussion.  I said it had to be the minimal version because we couldn't release shit.  Our coworker was suprised by my language but Prasad took it in stride.  He got more and more distant.   I went out to try to find a job at the library.

Finally I found a suitable place and started to go.  But then I thought that I might be in a dream so I threw myself into a lake by a stone walkway accross from an intersection to wake myself up.  I did wake up and found my self lying with the beige covers.  A dream within a dream.  I had some boxes that I had to take through airport security.  They had fit together nicely before but after I had opened them they were a bit clumsy to push along with a two wheeled trolley.  I had pornographic pictures in there and I started to look at them but then put them away, hoping customs wouldn't find them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org18075a4">
<p>
The establishment was an all you can eat.  It was run by the Japanese Mafia.  You had to pay the entrance each day.  It was about $90.  They were very nice to you once you had proven that you had paid the fee.  It was very important to them and they made a big point of it.
</p>

<p>
The first day I paid and left something there.  So my father paid for me to go back the second day.  Everyone was so nice and made me feel like I belonged there, once they had seen my ticket valid for the day.  The boss would come by and he would enforce the fact that you were their guest &#x2013; if you had paid for the day. He was very Japanese mafioso.
</p>

<p>
So when on the third day I remembered that I had left a mess, I went back to clean it up, because I felt like I was on the inside.  As I did, I saw some nice things like pails of frosting and started to pick them up to take with me.  That certainly would have been accepted when I was a member.
</p>

<p>
The waitress stopped me when she saw me carrying these things to confirm that I had a ticket.  It was OK as long as I had the ticket.  But I had gotten wet, could the ticket in my back pocket have become damaged?  Because of course I had the ticket, right?  
</p>

<p>
At first I said that I did, hoping they would leave me alone.  But then I decided that I couldn't keep up the pretense.  So I explained to them that I had just wanted to clean up the things from yesterday.  The waitress, who had been so friendly suddenly turned cold and explained that she couldn't be friends with someone who wasn't up front about things.  
</p>

<p>
Her and one of the other helpers guided me down the stairs while I tried to apologize for my mistake.  I wanted to know if there was any way that I could bribe them to let me go.  They didn't respond to the offer.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the spiral staircase were the doors to the outside.  It was a beautiful bright clear sunny day outside, you could see through the glass doors.  I saw the boss leaving by the door.  He eyed me knowingly but said nothing. They let me to a door to the right of the main door and left me.  But it was too small to get through.  I would have to try to get out the main door.
</p>

<p>
And there, sitting on the steps blocking most of the doorway, was the bouncer.  He looked at me and I could see that there was no pity in his eyes.

</p>

<p>
As soon as I made up my mind to do that, the entire lobby lifted up, spun into the air and went twisting off to somewhere unknown.
</p>

<p>
When it landed, I didn't know where I was.  I tried to figure it out on my cell phone but it wouldn't work properly.  It was on the steps of a tiered garden, with plantings and fountains and tennis courts.

Also a whole bunch of old CDs like Microsoft Encarta.  I had these things in a bag for my mom and was talking to some of the other workers there at TK who were in the basement of 1377.  But they kept mistaking my bag for the trash and threw away their lunch and stuff in it.  I tried not to say anything, not wanting them to realize what it was and just planning to clean it up myself later when no one would notice.  But eventually it just got to be too much with all the messy food.

I was sitting on the boulevard outside 1377 cleaning my RV.  I opened the door into the street, just right over the curb.  And another RV came along and drove right next to it and took the door off.  The driver started to stop but then just drove away.  I tried to get my cell phone out to take a picture of the license plate.  I almost remembered the serial number of the RV but not the license plate.  But when I tried to take a picture I ended up pressing the wrong button.  I got upset and threw a temper tantrum, which actually felt quite good.  Then I realized that I should just put the camera button alone on the second screen so that I could have quick access to the camera when I needed it for the next time.  I started do delete stuff off my phone and I think I may have deleted the virus game that made it hard to use the phone because it opened up the game on  boot up.

I was going to a board meeting except that the board meeting was in the dining room of 1377.  Reggie Perrin was there and he adjusted his tie and said 'I'm too old for this.' or something to that effect.  I tried to take notes but I was writing with acyrlic pen on some kind of plastic thing.  A lady came by and told me to invest in an organizational system.  So I went to the printer to grab some more paper.
</p>

<p>
In the cafeteria was Les Rustad.  We then went into the museum and started looking at some of the older devices that we had worked on.  Just as the current project was finishing, management was announcing a new major platform.  repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
I was riding in a car in California, which was like Burnsville.  The old project was a big thing with new everything which was the reason for failure.

I was going to school from my room in 1377.  I had a bag of M&amp;Ms, a bag of peanut M&amp;Ms and a bad of snickers bars.  It was a long run down the hill and along the highway through the snow.  Then I realized that I had forgotten my backpack so that I would have to run back for it.  I started running back, cutting accross the fields.  I thought that at least I would get my exercise in.  I was suprised at how far I could run without getting tired.
</p>

<p>
They changed the format of the school so that you were guided to a different class with each new hour so I stayed for the whole day.  Then when they had it so that you were choosing your classes and the schedule was all mixed up I had to leave in the middle.
</p>

<p>
I was riding my wheelchair to the exit which was &#x2013; for accessible access instead of the stairs &#x2013; a conveyer belt / escalator like thing.  Someone else was in a wheelchair and a third person was saying that they weren't really handicapped.  I thought that unless one is a doctor and can diagnose that a person is not handicapped, they are handicapped if they identify as such.

It was a hallway in Norma Banks' house that was a bunch of labs in a school (Linwood).  To the left it opened out on the north shore.  To the right it jogged into another hallway.  There were 4 of us playing D&amp;D:  me, John, another friend and a newcomer.  I had arranged for a battle.  The newcomer said that they would join but before they said they would actually attack, they went off on a motorbike ride with John's older brother David.  The newcomer had a DX of 4.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to figure out how to proceed and was going to proceed with the battle 'as if'.  There had to be a separate reality bubble they were wrapped in, created by fire.  Then the attacks would depend on fire; fire from behind.  And because the counter attack would also be fire it would double in strength - be 'super effective' :-) .

<p>
I was running slolem between ladders in a hallway at 1885.  I was thinking of going to see a psychologist.  Because I found it hard to be interested in things that other people were interested in.  I was only interested in my own things.  And my own things were tiny and precious.

I was supposed to shoot him in the eye with this cyberpunk kind of pistol.  I asked if I couldn't just shoot him in the forehead.  He said no, that would just hurt even more.  I shot it into a machine and the machine took care of the rest.

In a hallway which was a bedroom with a girl.  She had two children.  I was looking through some of her old photographs and there was a cute animal.  To flirt with her I said that now I knew what I wanted to come back as.  She came over and sat next to me but wasn't ready to kiss.
</p>

<p>
I was at work.  We were detectives and we were in a long hallway sloping downwards with old machines.  Someone came in with a problem.  The Japanese were producing a new device that didn't require the auxilliary chip.  It turned out that it was at a premium so there was no problem, you either got the premium version or the normal with the auxilliary chip.  Standard decision.
</p>

<p>
I didn't know what to do with the rest of the day so I went to the corridors to have fun.  I was gliding on a raft.  I had to break through the doors and push away furniture because they no longer supported this.  That one guy from TK was there and he was surprised to see me go into the corridors.  I went to where they were storing the food.  It was the guards last day and he said he was going to report me.  I recommended that they store all the milk products together.
</p>

<p>
We had to fight the jabberwok.  This involved going into the underworld.  I was armed with a magic spell and Gilgamesh was there to raise the armies of the stone soldiers.  But by the time we got to the jabberwok these were all used up so I had to use the one ring and a sword.
</p>

<p>
When I came back from the underworld the girl was there and I complained to her that I had won the battle but lost the war because I had had to use the one ring and violence and that had woken up the master.  I had also lost her love.  Two wars.

I sat in the first meeting; we were sitting on benches and tables like it was Open School.  I couldn't remember the details of the projects that I was working on.  I said that I had to go to a meeting for a different project, but even that was one that we were working with them on.

I needed some paper.  I borrowed the lady's notebook next to me but she drooled on the page.  There were no other pages blank so I gave it back to her and went to the office to get some blank paper from the copy machine.  As I was opening up the copy machine to get the paper, someone came in and said that there was recycled paper.  He went to get the box of recycled paper and took some.  So I went through that until I found something suitable.  I  went and sat at a small desk in a corner of a hallway and tried to organize the papers.  It was very bright.

As I was walking to the class, the boss commented on how close to late I was.  Then asked if I was ready for the 8 hour class.  I didn't realize it was 8 hours.  I thought it was only 1 hour.

<p>
When I got there, it wasn't a math class it was a physics class and Mike Turnure, who I knew knew more physics than me was in the class.  So I had to treat it like a seminar.  I wanted to investigate the theory that compressing helium made it conducting and that bubbles of helium in the upper atmosphere were what caused lightning.

We were making food in a big marketplace/cafeteria.  We had a big black cast iron cauldron and my mother and I were making tapioca in it.  We were debating about putting more tapioca vs. more water.  We thought we had way too much because we thought that the cauldron was full.  But I discovered that actually all the tapioca had floated to  a thin layer on the top and the rest was just water.  So really there was just barely enough for the two of us.

Dan Smith had a sophisticated game/CD/DVD player and he left us to look after it for a minute.  But I had to walk away and I was afraid that someone would take it.  It was also a vape device.  I decided that was too personal so I didn't use it.

Gayatri left before I did so I decided to sit in on a class.  The subject was whether you could unintentionally flirt. I said that you couldn't because any interaction would immediately be understood as flirting.  Saying this to the girl I was flirting with.

It was way after close of buisiness in the shopping mall.  I saw Bob Rajala walking away, having worked late.  I went to take a shower in a convenience store amongst the candy.  I dried off partially and put my same clothes back on, slightly damp.

I was going to go to the 9:00 one and then the 9:30 and then come back to the 9:00 one.  The 9:30 one had been scheduled before the other &#x2013; by Ajith.  I was sitting in my office, which was a cube on a road in a forest, trying to be sure I knew which meeting rooms I was in for the day when Dave Banks came in and asked if we could talk a little before the 3 day meeting on WBS. I explained that WBS was just a list of tasks.

I had to go to a shower in the basement of Open School 1885.  Someone got me dressed in green velvet pajamas.  I looked for my underwear in a drawer but was out.  This was the second time this had happened.   I decided to go commando.  I thought I knew the way to the showers but everything was different.  Some younger kids were telling me it was one level down but I thought I knew better.  I went where I thought it was.  There were rows of bicycles.  I turned back before the turnstiles at the exit.  I was worried about how much time I was spending just running up and down.  There were incredibly large people exercising to music to my left and they were sweating profusely.

They explained that although the distance of multiple light-years was too great to be done linearly, by wrapping the tube up in a coil and then connecting the pieces of the coil it could be made in parallel.  I tried to understand the math behind it because it didn't seem to work &#x2013; the supplier of the coil would have to make it linearly anyway &#x2013; but eventually gave up as the NASA guide was obviously convinced that it did work out.

My father was driving me in a semi to a house like the Sheer's.  It was down to its foundation.  Over stones and a bumpy road he got it parked in the narrow driveway.  I wondered if he would be able to back it out after they had put the house back up.  A lady was there and explained that they could take away the corner of the house or the semi could try to go forward up the hill to get out.

We went inside.  They had recently combined the house with the adjacent trailer home.  I asked, jokingly, how the merger of North and South Korea was going.  They didn't seem to think it was funny.

Like ambulances flashing red lights but like informational signs used by road crews.  I fast forwarded to see when it got to zero.  It went on a lot longer than expected and then there was nothing.  Then after a long time with nothing, a single motorcycle came by.  I backtracked to find out what the lone motorcyclist was.  I zoomed in on him and he was a question mark, and alien.

In an apartment on the street with Gayatri.  Had to triple-lock the door.  Someone on the TV was doing some anti-war illuminati thing and I thought it was really cool.  Really fine detail in the border with lots of whitespace.  Trying to go to the bathroom when two ladies came in and they wouldn't let me alone.  I wanted to finish reading my phone.  It turned out she had to go really bad and wouldn't leave.  I got off the toilet but my clothes got stuck and we ended up ripping the seat off.  We could fix it though and I left them to it.

I needed to get to a major airport.  I was on the tube and I took the wrong route.  I started to get off but someone was in my way so the train left before I could get out the door.  I sat down next to the door and waited for the next stop but the train went past several stops.  I was getting farther away from where I needed to be even to turn around to get to my next destination.  Other people came and sat near me waiting to get off.

Was going to the store.  The checkout counter was down the stairs in a library.  They were selling weed legally now.  You had to ask and then go pick it up.  Because you rolled in it so that it got on your clothes.  I didn't ask first and so the ladies at the checkout counter were wondering what weight I had on my clothes.  But then Clayton was there and he helped me pick out some buds and flowers.  I had just had stems before.  He didn't have a lot left.  The stems were there to protect the buds during the winter and he was worried about the coming winter.

April 26th 1992 by Sublime had a different part in the middle where he recounted all the different drugs he had taken.  "I've got so much chlorine in my veins that every time I flush the toilet it gets clean."  Something like that.  And a metaphor for herion.

I had a video interview for an internship.  I was physically there but they could only see me through a TV screen.  I did well with the team but the main boss fixated on the way I left Johnson and I looked nervous in the video.  I had to move the camera all around and it was pointing at me then not pointing at me then pointing at me again.
</p>

<p>
After the call ended I was able to go behind them and listen in on their converstaion.  Because I was in cyber space and they were in regular space.  They were angling toward a younger candidate, more recently out of college.  It was an internship after all and in retrospect I wondered why the talent agent had sent me for this interview.  I put a good face on it saying I wasn't so unhappy that they didn't like me if the reason was that they were going for someone fresh out of college.

I was walking up a hill and around a path.  There were a lot of soldiers camped out there.  I thought boy I wouldn't want to be like that with no life of the mind.  It was cold and I was overdressed.  But I didn't care because now I was comfortable and it was actually quite pleasant to walk out in cold.  A black gentleman carrying his young son came past me the other direction on the path. He was overdressed for the cold as well and that also made me feel better even though he had the excuse that he was protecting his child.
</p>

<p>
As I went along the path behind where the soldiers were camped, I saw that far from engaged in mindless pursuits, the soldiers were all looking at maps of the earth and sky, studying geography and astronomy.  Many had pictures of the stars of the southern hemisphere, upside down.  
</p>

<p>
I thought this was great, and would be a great way to teach people, if there was this shared interest in reviewing maps.  Just put information as infographics in maps.
</p>

<p>
I walked further along the path and came to the top of a tall hill.  I was struck with the beauty of the scene even though it was just ordinary trees it was almost impressionist.  I decided to take a picture but was then having trouble with the camera.  There were four settings on the camera and then an empty area.  I kept putting my fingers on the lens.  The sight was not the same as the lens.  It got stuck in zoom mode and I zoomed in on the temperature dial on a stove from somewhere.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the hill was school.  I was teaching but it was more like I was trying to recruit for my seminar.  There were a number of students in a class &#x2013; someone elses class &#x2013; and I was trying to think of activities for them afterwards.  I thought of having them all make bulky clothing and stage a mock battle.  One student came by with and interest in reindeer milk.  We got in a discussion about how much of the reindeer was eventually used.  This discussion happend in a hallway. We went back to the reception, which had a large glass window in front and couches, in front of trophy displays and the entrance to the auditorium.  
</p>

<p>
I was trying to look at my schedule.  I was always rushing even though I didn't have a clear idea of what I was doing.  Or maybe because I didn't have a clear idea of what I should be doing.  A young girl was helping me, one of the students.  I looked at the schedule, Tuesday &amp; Thursday afternoons.  After the real class that the other person was teaching. the students <i>might</i> come to mine.  I had two separate hours on those afternoons pencilled in for different things.  Then a two hour class that I had forgotten what it was.  I had a list of all the students and was going to try to write down the different project that each of them was going to do.

I was on top of the stadium trying to fix some mechanical part.  It had a phillips screw on top and a flat screw on the bottom.  It turned out the bottom part was the one that I needed to adjust.  I had the right size for the phillips but the flat was oversized.  I had to insert the screwdriver into a little plastic tube that bent away from the metal device.
</p>

<p>
I was on the train going south, away from work.  I wasn't planning on going to school.  It was Wednesday and I hadn't been to class on other Wednesdays so I thought it best not to complicate things.  It takes so much time to get the the university and back and it would interfere with my schedule for other things.  I thought about how this was a train of giving up and running away for me but others used it for a regular communte.  The train was expensive and not much used.  Thirty Euros.  It went down by 35W.  I went one stop to far and determined to get off at the next stop.
</p>

<p>
I followed the other people off the train and onto the bus without realizing it. It was the number 10 bus going towards downtown between Cleaveland and Snelling.  Other passengers were talking with the driver about what number it was.  Because it used to be called the 10 but now it was called the 4.
</p>

<p>
I got home to 1377 and went into my room which was very messy.  There was an old woman there who I hugged.  There was some concern over whether I still had a girlfriend or not and if I should flirt with her.  
</p>

<p>
My mom came in with a big bowl of mashed potatoes with lots of butter.  I said I didn't want them because potatoes weren't really my thing.  Brighteyes was standing in the open back door.  There was a tub of plain vanilla ice cream on the floor but I didn't want that either.  I had a couple of power bar in my backpack which I really wanted but I was saving them.  There was some Ethiopian bread on the shelf but the back had been left open and it had gone bad.  There was another burger there with it and I took a bite but had to spit it out because it was next to the Ethiopian bread that had gone bad and so was probably contaminated as well.  There was then a bunch of spinach etc. that I had spit out in the trash.

I turned on the old black and white television.

Sitting at a table in the corner of a library.  We were there with Peter and Brad Skillicorn.  We were talking about Peters work.  We spent the whole day there, eating and leaving a mess on the table.  At the end as we were getting up I asked if we were going to talk about my project.  I couldn't even remember the name of it.  
</p>

<p>
We were going to a chinese restaurant with .. from Watlow.  The other got wine and I got beer.  The glasses they had were small and from a cafeteria machine like you would get milk from.  We went and sat down at a table.  It was cramped.  Someone bumped the table and most of the beer bubbled away.  I didn't care and figured I just wouldn't drink it anyway.

I went to work even though I had been let go.  I was talking to people but not letting on that I was no longer there.  I was wondering about how to clean things up.  Finally I realized that I had nothing to do and that I might as well leave.  This place was like the florists on Snelling near St. Clair.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to clean up my work.  It was like a refrigerator with a cable connecting the computer to the top.  I had a lot of stuff that I rearranged.  Bottles that were intended to be use cases.  I thought I needed to git rid of a lot of it.  A lot of it I had pirated.  As I was cleaning up and rearranging, the computer started complaining about power and network problems.  It didn't turn on except in degraded mode.  As I was trying to fix it they said that since you wouldn't be coming back there was no point.  The refigerator was in a place like Thermo King that was in a place like a department store.
</p>

<p>
As I was leaving I had to get accross a highway that was under water.  Some others were coming with me.  They kept telling me to wait until the cars had gone by.  Finally I went.  There was one car that was coming and I made it before it came.  But when I went, I pulled the earth of the side of the highway behind me and the car had to slow down for that before it went back.  This was the northeast side of the interesction of 35 and Snelling, leaving from a department store that was Rosedale.

I was working at my desk, which was a long bench which was in TK which was in the basement of 1377.  I got interested in looking at a fuzzy speck.  I wasn't sure if that was part of my job or not but I figured I was going to do it.  The workstation to my right had a professional microscope and no one was using it so I went to use that one.  In my login, I had been configuring the operating system, so some things were hard to access, like the web browser didn't have a border so it was hard to move around.  I thought about cleaning the system and resetting it but I couldn't because it was also used for the microscope workstation by others.  I thought it strange that my main machine was also being used by others and that that was why I had started using the lesser machine to the left.

<p>
In open school (Linwood), everyone was singing "Friends of 'P'" &#x2013; except it was a Metallica version.  Someone in the hall asked me if I could call them on the phone to check if their phone was working.  They expected I knew their name because I was their friend but I didn't so I asked for the number.  He gave the 4 digit number to me.  Not really sure if he was testing the phone or testing to see if I remembered his name.  If so I failed.  I got distracted and when I finally got around to finding a phone &#x2013; in a classroom under a table &#x2013; and started to call him, he came in to explain that he had already fixed his phone.  There was some discussion over who was the 'P' that everyone was so excited about and the implication was that it was me!

At school I crawled into the air ducts.  Previously the way had been blocked but workmen had come in and opened it up.  I thought that it was going to be greatly to my advantage when I got to the spirit world that I had spent so much time practicing in these places.  I thought that I would be able to fly, but I could only proceed at a normal pace.

A film was being made.  It was a very complicated film and the actors were reharsing the precise order in which they were crossing the street.  One was crossing Snelling at St. Clair on the north side and the other was crossing St. Clair at Snelling on the west side.  This was complicated by the fact that you had to account for the other pedestrians, who were public, not extras.  The actors were in the green room discussing the whole operation.  
</p>

<p>
The director was trying to get a special actor from India.  The mentor of the actor was a veteran singer.  The student of the singer was an actor who was playing in a new movie about a kid who tapes himself on his home equipment and becomes a star.  The music was such that it was taped over so many times that it became a sort of drone in the background.  I felt a great envy because that was something I wanted to do and it seemed grossly unfair that I never had decent enough equipment to do so properly.
</p>

<p>
The next scene was where the doctor was in the surgery.  His friend was the lawer.  The doctor bungles the surgery and the director informs him that he is dismissed.  He goes into her office and murders her with a knife very graphically.  The sequel is how the lawer helps to get him out of prison after being convicted.
</p>

<p>
We are in the upstairs bedroom of 1377 thinking about the sequel.  I am trying to sneak to the bathroom but there are people coming in and out, flirting with me homosexually.  I go back and sit down on my bed.  Everyone comes in and starts to try to figure out the dialog for the sequel that we are working on.  They get wrapped around the axle debating different lines.  I put down a rule that if they can't agree, everyone will write down their idea and then we will pick the best one.  I am wondering to myself how that differs from what is already going on except for the extra step of making everybody write it down.  Yet they agree to it.  They put a time limit of 10 minutes on it.  I say 9 minutes to emphasize the time sensitive nature of it all.  
</p>

<p>
I am trying to find paper to write on.  I find some old computer printout paper and wonder if I was saving it as a memento and therefore shouldn't use it.  It didn't have enough room on it so I tried to find something else.  I tried to write with a carbon pen on some old cast iron pans that were stacked up but someone else already had; mostly a list of names.  When you touched the pan with the carbon pen a bunch of the carbon would ball up, held together electrostatically. This eventually turned into a little mouse shape that would run accross the pan.  The person next to me did this and then I did it and the two mice started playing and chasing each other.
</p>

<p>
The way the lawyer was going to get the doctor off depended on falsifying some evidence around the timeing of events.  This meant having a car's emmissions testing redone with a different result.  The lawer was driving and I was in the back seat.  We went up a big bridge to the emmissions testing station.  The lawer started to ride up against the righthand fence.  This had something to do with the way he was going to fake the emissions test.  Then we broke past the fence, off the bridge, and went flying onto another bridge, made of wood, that his accomplicies had been building.  It went up and down like a roller coaster and then came back to the ground.  We went along the wooden planks that they were laying down like railway tracks for a while and then they petered out because the men hadn't finished.  We got that far and the lawyer said that it would be enough.
</p>

<p>
We were on our way to the airport.  I was very worried because the last time they had been full and I had been the last person so I couldn't get on the plane.  We got to the last step where they had a cafeteria we could get food.  Gayatri stopped to get some food and was taking a long time about it, unconcerned that we wouldn't be allowed on the plane.  I went straight through the line, didn't pick up any food, and tried to get past the checkout at the end.  But there wasn't any way past.  The lady at the checkout counter asked me if I was really just going to have raisins and nuts on the plane.  I broke down crying about how I hadn't been let on the plane last time.  She assured me that there was room this time; that they weren't oversold.  I went back to find Gayatri who hadn't gotten any food yet but was sitting at one of the tables.

Jimmy Turnure, Dennis and I were at 1377.  We decided to go to Fort Snelling, which I knew was on highway 55.  We got in the car and I was driving.  It wasn't too hard to adjust and use the brake and accelerator (like it sometimes is in dreams).  I went straight up Snelling because that was the way I was used to going.  When I came to a sign for highway 51 I realized that I had gone the wrong direction, so I turned back down highway 51 which connected with 55 and I hoped that they wouldn't notice the huge detour.  But 51 stopped at a fence and you had to hop over it to get to 55.  So I left the car there and went back to 1377 on foot.  I sat there cross legged in the middle of the living room floor waiting for them to come back feeling bad that I had wasted so much time and left the car up north.

I was lying in bed in my apartment.  It was a double apartment.  Someone came in and woke me up.  It was a young black woman.  I was like, 'Do I know you?'.  Then the rest of the group came in and I remembered what it was.  It was a complicated scheme to rescue (kidnap) a child that we felt was at risk.  Caroline had figured out a way to get in to the house without making noise and taught it to one of this group.  Put water on the basket, insert the basket and that opened the door.  So they were able to get in and take the baby.  Then they planned a complicated double-back in the apartment building to avoid being followed.  They succeeded and had come back here with the baby as agreed previously.  
</p>

<p>
Two business men &#x2013; Professor Roberts and my dad?  &#x2013; came by.  They were also part of the scheme and were planning to tell their company that they didn't like where they were staying so that they would have an excuse to move closer.  Dennis was explaining to the other guy that it was called 'the burbs'.  'We will complain about "the burbs".'  We knew that we were all accomplicies to kidnapping but we felt it was the right thing to do.  
</p>

<p>
Then we were in court.  We had taken the baby because it was being mistreated by the mother.  The father was mostly absent and said that his reason was that because of her deep anti-abortion principles he couldn't force her to abort the child of the son.  The lawers asked, 'well if you had been forceful, like a macho guy in a movie&#x2026;' and then the name of the guy went down the line of laywers seated there, each one mentioning a different macho guy until it came to our guy &#x2013; the one who didn't know that 'the burbs' was slang for the suburbs.  He suddenly realised that you can't force a woman at all and said so.   The message went back up the line as a sudden realization.  There was a big questionmark hanging over the statement about the son.  Then she came in and it was revealed &#x2013; acutally the child was a product of incest with her older child (queue suspenseful music)!   
</p>

<p>
She was in the balcony and the older child was being led by police.  He gave her the finger.  She smirked and turned away.  The commentator said he was like a badger who only new one trick &#x2013; to claw at everything around him.

Leaving John (Norma) Banks' house &#x2013; we couldn't get a band together.  I tried to fly up in the air but everything was darkness.  Then there were little specs of light and then a big light in the distance.  I thought 'Oh no, this isn't going to turn out just to be falling snow in the streetlight and I am a bum!' But that is exactly what it was.  I couldn't fly much past the streetlight.  I didn't have many clothes on and I didn't have anywhere to go but a nearby forest park.  I thought it was going to be very cold, but that was what I asked for.

The captian stood in front of the door to the ship, on the chemically treated ground and challeged the ihabitants of the ship.  The door opened and they started firing at him.

The preacher was speaking.  We were in a regular room all sitting at tables, not a church.  He started talking about contraction.  Gayatri, who was sitting on my lap, said oh, yes, when the water creates a bubble, it will be filled with air.  This was also an eastern teaching, see.  It was all a metaphor for mans relation with god.  I said, 'Oh, are we talking about the Kabbalah now?' because this is of course the lurianic concept of tzimtzum.  Everyone looked at each other and they were all like 'Kabbalah, what is Kabbalah?'

I was sitting in the northwest corner of the porch of 1377.  There was a picture there.  It was of an artist who was painting a picture by candlelight.  A lady was looking over his shoulder and couldn't see the candle.  I thought that I should stop hiding the fact that I was smoking marijuana from my girlfriend.  In the dream I was very high.

I was at TK and one of the junior engineers said something.  Gayatri wanted him to take it back but I was all like, 'No, your career is going to go on a lot longer than mine, it's a fair criticism.'.

We were all on a bicycle.  I was in the back and so I could only pedal, not steer.  We had a nice breakfast in the corner of a gymnasium.  I tried to rearrange the seating based on height and who could steer, but there wasn't much we could really change.  Then we headed out.  Mama told me to stop eating my food so badly, if I was going to do that I could just leave.  So I immediately got off the bike without taking money, keys or phone and went into the building.

I started flying down the stairs, doing gymnasics around the bannisters and thinking about what I was going to do.  The building was mostly empty but not completely, some of the shop owners were still there but no customers.  As I felt I had to now start a life of crime, I didn't want to compromise my morality for something small and kept looking around for a real prize, some jewelry or something.  I looked through a shop that was empty and had large cupboards with old fashioned dresses in them.

I went out and talked with a professional theif who explained about knowing the value of everything, like what a box of 'unlabeled' (stolen) VCR tapes would fetch from the fence.

I went to give my report to the boss but the boss had moved.  My report was mumbled and muddy because I wasn't expecting to give it in the new way.  The office was closed down and we were sitting around on chairs outside.  Also I was nearly asleep through most of it.  There was a new boss and they were getting an informal report.  Brad Ludwig was there and he understood the new way of doing things, which was kind of back to the old way.  I was actually kind of glad for the change as it added more structure and I had been kind of aimless, including getting involved in some plays that Dan Smith had been putting on.

I was in a school.  I was supposed to be reorganizing the layout of the offices.  I had a bunch of notes but I had to get them organized better.  I went to a hallway and organized all the papers that I had prepared, including the ones for deep in the building where they weren't going to be rearranging anytime soon.  Emerson Lake &amp; Palmers Brain Salad Surgery was playing.  I went back out to explain it all to the team but they were all distracted by something else.

<p>
We were in a large factory fair.  There were concession stands all over.  I was with a young boy because it was a school trip.  He went to the concession stand.  He finished eating his ham sandwich on a baguette.  It was very dry.  I thought it would be quite unappetizing but he ate it.  Then he ordered another ham and cheese sandwich without the ham and cheese for 3 GBP.  The lady at the concession stand gave him a small piece of ham and he paid.  I tried to intervene on his behalf because it wasn't fair that he pay for the whole thing but there was a tall eastern european man next in line who was being very pushy and beligerant and wanted to be served immediately so he kept pushing forward blocking me out and demanding to be served.

And this meant that each and every particle of our body was connected to that single point and it was what gave us our uniqueness even though all the particles were separate.

We went to the checkout counter and I saw the other CD that some of the other kids were getting and smiled remembering.  We started counting out the cash.  The 20 notes were long and thin like 1 1/2 inches by a foot.

The professor seemed to accept it and maybe even actually respect me more.  Then I was looking over his shoulder at the screen and he was looking at something that had to do with popular culture; a video or some music.  The computer was on a table of desks in a room adjoining a hallway.  There were windows opposite the hallway that looked out on some trees.  I offered to research it for him.  He didn't seem opposed to the idea.  Then I sat in a heap in the middle of the hallway.

We were sitting in a room with a domed roof that was for elementary school kids.  There were stairs down to the next floor.

I went out and I managed to climb past the border of that reality bubble.  There were trees and snow and it was cold and I never wanted to go back.

I told him that I thought my presentation was a little weak, trying to feel him out on the subject.  He started talking about something different, more strategitc, a higher level meeting that he had been in that I hadn't even known about. He wasn't really concerned with the issues at my level.

It was a movie about the time just before WWII.  The movie actor went to an exclusive hotel on a hill, address #875.  There he withdrew a large amount of money from a hiding place that only he knew about. Then he went back into the town of Brussels.  He met a girl in the square.  Then he went to the meeting.  Hitler was rising and Stalin had asked all the countries to join in a defence union.  This was the meeting where the countries were going to decide whether to accept Stalin's offer.  The way it was playing out, all the countries that were refusing the offer were eventually to become the allies in WWII.  This was because of the way Stalin initially sided with Hiter before splitting.  
</p>

<p>
Hitler was planning to bomb the meeting, but this was already known and the bomb had been defused.  It turned out to be in the Dutch ambassador's area.  But because it was diffused it just made the coffee bubble a little and we all looked at it and sniggered about having outsmarted hitler.

<p>
After the meeting the move actor went back to the square to meet the girl.  They agreed to take the train out of town together.  But the soldires were also volunteering for the upcoming war.  Would he go with her or would he see his duty to volunteer?  He went back up to #875 but he changed his mind and didn't go in.  He turned around, went down a hill of slippery pebbled and walked off along the train track on his own.

It went way in, further than I thought it should.  Then the urine stared coming out.

You are the doctor.  The enemy of the daleks.  Hey, what you doin', girl?  I was on a bus and the person behind me said "You are the doctor, the enemy of the daleks.".  I turned to the seat behind me and there was a dalek peeping out over the back of the seat.  I was afraid but then I realized that it was just somebody playing around and said "Hey, what you doin', girl?"

<p>
Access specialties was a room with a barrier.  There were many young women in the room and I was standing behind the barrier.  Someone &#x2013; also a woman, commented on how large everyone's breasts were.  They were all either D cups or Box B cups (which stick out more) she said.  I stayed behind the barrier.  I thought that it was beneath someone of my level to not greet the visitors but I really felt more comfortable back there with my head down.  
</p>

<p>
They all trundled out and then I came out from behind the barrier.  I went to find a place to work but there were no computers.  I finally found one in a library like area, but it turned out to be just a scanner that looked like a laptop.

<p>
There was some mechanical thing that we had to fix and I was changing the wires out and trying to get the interface working.  I had to twist two frayed wires together to make the connection.  We went out to a picnic bench and continued working on it.

I was at work.  Work was in the corner of the St. Paul YMCA.  I was picking up small pieces of plastic.  Mariela came by and touched my penis.  I didn't react because I knew I couldn't do anything about it.  But I didn't move away either.  Then we were going home and she was fixing her bike.  But I just kept going because I knew I couldn't do anything about it.  
</p>

<p>
Then I went to the bus stop and got on the number 21 bus.  The bus went along until it came to a hill and then it started to go backwards.  We all looked at each other.  It went backwards faster and faster.  A huge wave came in to the houses on the side and scared the wildebeast which started running along side the bus.  It was on fire and it had to dive into the water to put itself out even though it was scared of the water.

A workman came and needed to see the manuals.  We went into the basement to get them.  I tried to get through a tiny, dirty, concrete ventilation shaft that I had been through before the other direction but I was too big to get through.  I turned around to go the other direation but there was a small (about 6") square hole in the door that we had just come through and no way to open it from this side.  I was worried for a moment that we were trapped but then I just knocked on the door and Younes opened it up and we went into a lab area with computer equipment.

I landed on the line of cars just where it became a train going into a tunnel.  I ended up between the engine and the first car.  It was very hot where my feet were and I had to lift them up.  I was wrapped in a blanket.  Someone asked me if I was ok and I said sure, I just had to pick my feet up a little.

I was looking for a place to sit in the school.  I walked through the children's area.  I wondered if people would think I was out-of-bounds.

I finally found 3 empty round tables and started to sit down when someone else came and sat right next to where I was going to sit.  I yelled at him in a paranoid way, actually stating that he had done that just to bother me.  He felt chagrined but denied any conspiracy.  I wandered off to find a better place to sit.

I was sitting at a table in a room.  This room was near the factory of TK but it was also one of the early rooms in Doom.  There were 3 computers at the table.  I was sitting there and so were two new but senior programmers.  They started complaining about the formatting of some of my code.  I had used snake<sub>case</sub> where I should have used CamelCase.  I started to explain the history behind it but then realized that it sounded like I was trying to justify it.  So I got upset and said, 'Look, this is simple; we are all in agreement that it should be changed.  You just have to put a ticket and we will agree to include the refactoring at the next [sprint].'

I was thinking how much happier I was with this leader.  I understood everything so much better.  It was kind of like soft social science, which I was good at.  She kept saying that expanding a volume increased temperature.

I became totally hypnotised.  When the meeting stopped for lunch, Gayatri suggested that I go get dessert.  But first I had to go to the bathroom.  I went to look for the toilet near the machines that vended the dessert and other items, but there wasn't one there.  The toilets were far away around the corner.  I started to get sad because it would take so long to go there that lunch would be over and I wouldn't get any dessert.

It was a movie.  We were all on an asteroid in space.  There were only 14 days left.  And there were 14 of us.  But we couldn't leave; we all had to go down with the ship.  The whole movie was going to be the debate over whether to declare an emergency and leave despite the fact that regulations didn't allow it or blindly adhere to the regulations and die when the asteroid did.  I was arguing for declaring an emergency and leaving.  It also seemed like there were more than 14 people there.  Apparently some of them were ready to leave because they weren't part of the skeleton crew list that had to stay behind so they were all preparing to leave before the end anyway.

I thought I would be lost in endless grocery stores, but I turned around and went back through the door to see memble from TK go into the meeting room so I followed him in there.  He was giving a presentation, scoring people on some funny quiz that they did.  He had a lazer pointer that projected unicorns and constellations on the walls and ceiling.  There was a dragon above the clouds and it blocked out the projection where it was.

I wondered if I should go to class or skip it.  I was afraid that if I went to class I might mistakenly think something that would send me in the wrong direction.  I had no money and I planned to just run myself out until I had nothing.  I could see from the people rushing down the street that if I had no money that would mean that there was less that I could do.  So that meant that money was just a way of speeding things up and I had no need to go fast.

He started to redo the calculation over and show us the menu with the prices where what we ordered was differetn by 3 cents from what the other customer had ordered. So I pulled out a nickel and handed it to him.  He wanted to redo the calculation but I said that I didn't have time to worry about 3 cents.  As we left, he said that he thought it was the principle of the thing.  I said, no, the amount matters too.  I would negotate for 10 months for a million dollar contract but only 1 month for a hundred thousand dollar contract for example.

We were in a valley.  This valley was surrounded by metal walls that held the water out.  There were some rocks there.  The rocks had funny shaped fossils on them.

It died there because of the foam and it and the foam were fossilized in place.

<p>
We were discussing this and realized that there were two possibilities. Because it was a billion years ago, it couldn't have been any modern life form we were familiar with.  So either life evolved twice independently on Earth or these formations came from an alien species.

<p>
I thought to myself that I didn't like to think about what it would mean if it was an alien species.  It would be totally alien and independent of any hierarchy on earth that we were familiar with.  It would just eat you without even thinking about it.  Then a giant creature like a squid with a shell came down the river from the other side and started to swallow us.  I had to unthink the dream.

We thought they were just playing but they actually crashed into the glass windows of the restaurant.  This involved them falling over and losing control temporarily in the process.  
</p>

<p>
We all ran and scattered.  I got on my horse and started flying over the planes.  They were ready for people to flee and had flights of arrows prepared.  I thought that I would be able to dodge the arrows but they came over in a cloud. Fortunately my armor protected me.  I stayed ahead of the next volley of arrows.  They arrows were little sparrows and were flying behind me.  My horse started to fly up into the air over the trees.
</p>

<p>
Still the sparrow arrows came behind me though there were fewer of them now.  I had to find a way to hide fropm them. There was a long bridge, with a tree covered walkway in the middle.  I flew onto that and they were unlikely to find me there.  As I walked along I came up to some dogs.  My horse was worried that they would be hostile but the first one, a small puppy, came up and sniffed me and it soon became clear that they would accept us.

We were driving up to an old factory that was a secret prison where all the most dangerous and insane mad scientists were kept and had been kept for 50 years.  There was a conspiracy afoot as some of them were due to be released after 50 years.  It turned out that the warden had been subverted by them on day one and had been part of the planning all along. She was wearing a funny helmet.

</p>

<p>
Someon wanted to crown me the king of the GDT and I wondered if it really shouldn't have been Joe Glentz.  There were lots of engineers sitting in cubicles across the way doing engineer things.  They were all staying focused just on the problems they were given or themselves discovered and not expanding the scope of their inquiry.

I was riding my horse into work.  I rode past the other children from school playing a game in a field.  There were two circles of children, one on the inside and one on the outside.  Like in musical chairs, they walked in different directions while the music continued.  The ones on the outside would try to run as fast as possible to get ahead as far as they could.  When the music stopped, the person on the outside ring who was farthest along would win, and also the person who was opposite them in the inner circle.  We thought about the strategy of this game since it seemed mostly randon, but it was really about knowing your skills when you chose which circle to get into at the beginning.  
</p>

<p>
To get in the building, the horses had to duck their heads.  The horse of the person in front of me ducked their head without needed to be guided, but mine only ducked their head when I ducked my head.  This meant that I almost hit my head on the ceiling.  The inside of the building was like the hallway in mechanic arts and there was a gymnasium inside.

<p>
Dennis Fischbach came out holding some posters in German.  I explained that I had been working on these for a project with Tim Hinricher.  Except I was mistaken and it was actually Brad Pierskalla.  I felt very embarrased that I had gotten the name wrong.  Management wanted to change the posters to English but I was emphatic about remaining international.

I was trying to get to work.  Work was at Linwood. Sort of.  I was in my Father's house, which was an older house out in the country.  He was gone and I wasn't sure when he was coming back.  He had gone to New Orleans/St. Louis.  He had been gone there for longer than expected and we hadn't heard from him.  
</p>

<p>
I went into the bathroom but the shower was in a separate room.  The clothes that I had brought were all disorganized and all over the floor.  It was hard to tell which were mine and which weren't; which I had brought with me this time and which I had left from before.  Finally I got my clothes figured out.  I was trying on different shoes until I found some that didn't look silly (like boots) and were comfortable (not dress shoes).
</p>

<p>
I went into the kitchen to get some quick breakfast before running out to work.  There were dishes and silverware strewn haphazardly everywhere.  Some of them clean and some of them dirty.  My mother came in.  I explained that I usually had cereal so would have peanut butter this time.  I took the last piece of bread.  I tried to find a clean knife.  The peanut butter jar turned out not to have much left in it; hardly enough for one slice.

I started to boot up my laptop but there was a virus on it that made it search for pictures of fat naked women.  It was a separate application, but I couldn't find the exit button.  The menues just went on and one with silly and frivolous things done in a childish and cartoonlike manner, for example Beatles trivia.  I started to worry about whether to contact IT and how I was going to back up the data and wipe the operating system to start over.

He and the others settled down to sleep overnight in the chairs and benches of the waiting room of the social services facility.  In the morning he started to complain about having to wait so long when it became clear that they might all have to wait a second night.  They finally started to lead him in to start the work.

We were on the train.  I thought I would get on a bicyle and meet them back at home.  I left them playing in a place that was Minneapolis but also unfinished 35E.  Earlier I had been able to put the bicyle together from the parts that were left on the train very quickly.  But this time I was unable to and missed my stop.  I tried to text them but my phone was in a different mode and all I was able to send was 'at 0' instead of 'at home'.  Home was north of University, but more rural.  
</p>

<p>
I thought about how I would get back.  Taking the train back would be the most obvious way.  I thought I might buy a small bicycle for $100 in the town and ride that back over days.  It would be an adventure.  I didn't have any money and I didn't know where I was going to get any money from.

<p>
The train was just supposed to go to Shakopee/Taylor's Falls but this one was actually going to Fargo/Thunder Bay.  So then I had to wonder how I would get back from there.

It was the first day of the last quarter of school.  I was in the hallway which was like the Mechanic Arts hallway outside the auditorium.  I had already passed all my classes so I was at liberty to do what I liked.  It was Tuesday at 2:30 when I had had a class that I went to last term so I assumed that I would go to the smae class but hadn't checked the schedule.  I sat down in the hallway to do some independent study.  I was trying to organize my computer.
</p>

<p>
There was a side hallway and I started to hang out with this girl.  Eventually I ended up in her room, which was off the side hallway.  At first she was quite posh and had half empty bottles of wine in her room.  But then she was quite plain and a little geeky.  We just kept sitting close to each other on her bed.

I was a graduate student.  Except that I had finished all my courses and had given up on my thesis.  But I was still in college waiting to find something.  I started going to teach my course.  I was just taking a class and teaching a class and it was all beneath me.  But I was hardly ever on time for my students.  I was walking along the road and along the fence.  It was a new road in a northern town.  I was glad that I was going to be on time for class for once and that I felt prepared enough for the class in the sense that I could just wing the examples.  
</p>

<p>
I was getting some equipment from the lab.  The lab was just south of the factory in TK.  Except that it was registration time so there were lines and lines of students also getting equipment.  I had to leave past the cashier.  I wanted to explain that I had a legitimate reason for taking the equipment away from the lab but there was no one to explain to and no one asked about it as I left.

Gayatri and I were going through some rooms.  They were in order from most holy to least.  First we found some whipping cream.  We were stepping on the tops of the furniture in the church that had been stacked up so close together you couldn't walk between them.  First some old wooden furniture then some stone.  Other people were there and we had to side step to avoid them stepping on us while we walked over the stone slabs and they passed us on the way.  Then some newer furniture and finally a liquor warehouse with barrels from ale to hard drinks.  We sat down at the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
As we walked along the street we saw a business that was closed on Sunday from 1:00 to 2:00.  Gayatri told me that this was very popular among the religious right wing.  There was a radio host who told everyone that they had to drop everything and listen at that time.  And they all sang this one song.  The song was supposed to have some kind of vauge watered down religious meaning.  But the most striking thing upon first hearing it was that the words were very difficult to understand and it was very easy to imagine them replaced with curse words.  Every chourus ended with mumble-mumble-UCK!  for example.

We were at a restaurant which was my bed from 1377.  Gayatri wanted some finger fucking so we arranged our bodies on the bed.  I was afraid we would get noticed but she was sure they were all asleep.  As we did it another lady came and lay on the bed with us, holding Gayatri's head.  Then I was doing it to Gayatri and looking at both of their naked breasts.
</p>

<p>
After that I went back to the (picnic-esque) tables from the restaurant.  All the food was non veg.  I grumbled and sat down to resign myself to my fate of not having much good to eat.  Someone came by with a pumpkin pie in a plastic cup.  I was like, really?  Is that a pumpkin pie in there?  They assured me that it was and moved some of it aside with a knife to show the layers inside.  I was like, wow, that is so kitsch its notable.  I should tell Trent about it.  So I got out my phone to take a picture and send to him but I couldn't get it to work.
</p>

<p>
We were at work which was an office which was the dungeon of 1377, but raised to the second floor like Mechanic Arts.  We were cleaning stuff up and walking on top of all the cabinets.  There was a name for something and I asked who called it that first and it was Carl Withey.
</p>

<p>
I went into an adjacent room which was the auditorium of a school.  It had very steep walls and a curtain at the back.  I took the curtain down and the room grew less quiet.  Then we tested the sound in the room with and without the curtain.
</p>

<p>
After that it became a Blake's Seven show.  We were getting in a spaceship with some new ladies.

I was in a saloon.  It was a cold winter and it was on the northwest corner of University &amp; Lexington.  There was some question about getting some shoes.  I got the shoes by right and that helped me walk over the drifts of snow that where there.  There were lots of people milling around.  The snow was slushy and wet the way it gets when lots of people walk over it.  But it wasn't very dirty.  I got a t shirt as well and almost a jacket.  
</p>

<p>
We were the police and we had arrested a man.  But he was actually the reincarnation of Hoagy Charmichal so I thought we should let him go as that was so remarkable.  So I had to prove it which meant that he had to be able to sing the Hong Kong Blues.  So we sat down on some benches behind a barrier and I played the song on one of those little metal cups from India.  It was hard to play it and I played some wrong notes.  I also did too much of the singing for him but he got it in the end.   
</p>

<p>
Then everyone had to leave but I was late leaving so I couldn't get my jacket.  It was very cold outside and I didn't know what I was going to do but at least I had my shoes and t-shirt.
</p>

<p>
I went and sat at a pub with a friend outside.  Then a mad gangster with a large automatic weapon came and pointed it at me.  He insisted that it was his t-shirt.  Since he was pointing a gun at me, my friend and I agreed that I had just made a mistake.  I took the t shirt off and gave it to him.  He left.  Then I was sitting there without jacket or t-shirt but at least I still had my shoes.

I hugged John Lennon's mom.  Her son strutting around in nylons and long hair had driven her crazy.  I said that all the joy we got from all those songs wasn't worth her pain; we would have found something else to dance to.

I was in an important meeting as ambassador.  I always made a point of having a cigarette and then spending some time reading before the meeting, which made it a little late.  The place was a giant auditorium and I flew there headfirst.  To get the the next meeting you had to dive in head first and fly around a corner.  It was a leap of faith.  I had done this before quite successfully and the manna was strong.  But this time I spun and went feet first which broke the manna.  I ended up outside zone 5 and in zone 4 where I was not supposed to be.  Fortunately because I was an ambassador someone let me back in the door to zone 5.  So it wasn't that I had so much power to fly it was that the place was giving me that power and when I accidentally went outside the power dropped.  
</p>

<p>
I had to find my way back to the meeting and I was going through a bunch of hallways and cafeterias in the basement.  The manna got weaker and weaker and eventually flying became slower than pushing myself along with the chairs.  And then that became slower and I just ended up walking.

I thought it was up near Duluth, but really it was only Maplewood Mall.  He drove us into the parking lot and restaurants of Maplewood Mall.  I asked if this was Maplewood Mall and he said yes.  There were others with us in the truck.

We were working on this really cool project and I was sitting around the table with two of my clients.

When I got back it was time to leave and we all started to go out.  We all had to go to the bathroom so I went with them.  Now we had to put all our pocket contents in a tray and get scanned by the machine. I complained that all I had in my pockets was my keys and that I had already been to the bathroom without any problems but they insisted.  I was worried about just leaving my keys in an open wooden tray but they insisted.

It was also a place with a government center.
Some very old statues.

I had to go along a twisty path in a park beneath some hills where some houses were.  It led through some shops and restaurants.  I turned back around after going through some shops.  There was a dog there.  A big dog, almost the size of a pony.  It ran past me.  Was I responsible for it?  It had gotten confused for some reason.  There, on the path that led directly away from the shops and back through the park, it started to jump up and bark.  It could see the clouds.   They were highly varied.  It thought it could jump up to reach one of the more lower lying strands.  Maybe it could.  Someone else also came out to attend to the dog.

Ulrich was driving to the test track. It was in Germany so he was on his home turf.  There were a bunch of little bridges with railings after a boulevard.  He drove through and around the bridges, but ran over the corners of them, causing the car to bump up uncomfortably.  
</p>

<p>
Then we got to a clearning where other people from his work were arranging the test tracks for the driving tests.  They had tracks made of many many balls that they could lay down and arrange in different shapes and angles.  They were smoothing them out by hand and with rakes and brooms to just the shape they wanted for the specific road test.

I was in a class, except that I was taking the class.  There were a handful of us who didn't do so well.  I was sat down at a table in a corner next to a door to the outside street with the teacher and an advisor.  I had done OK in the first term but had really slipped in the second term.  We were about 2/3 of the way through the second term now.  They were saying some vauge things, implying what could happen.  It was like they were having a conversation between themselves in a language I was shut out from.  
</p>

<p>
But I just came out with it.  I asked what grade I was likely to get if the rest of the term went as the first term had.  After some prevarication it became clear that the answer was a B.  I was all like, well that's not so bad, it is something that a college recruiter might be able to overlook as a single black mark.  They looked at me like there was something they wanted to say that they weren't saying.

We were sitting at a picnic-esqe table in a road like a food court under some machinery.  The other people at the table were complaining about how you used to be able to fix stuff yourself but now you had to take things into the shop and it was more expensive and took longer.

I interrupted them to reveal that that was my job; analyzing problems that people had in order to devise exceedingly complicated ways to overcome those problems that then just made things more difficult instead of simpler.

I was working on a program.  It was an old basic program except that I had to physically connect wires like in an old TTY or telephone.  And it was underwater.  This was the landing on the 2nd floor of 1377.  Then I went upstairs to a large room with wooden floors.  I was looking through some cupboard on the side to see if there was anything that I could use.
</p>

<p>
Then the wires started to smoke.  It's pretty bad when they can do that underwater.  So I was trying to fix that when a lady came in and asked me if I was almost done.  I explained that I had to take all the wires out and redo everything to avoid the short circuit so no, I was nowhere near almost done.

We were in a rental apartment.  It was a small room with not much more than a bed.  The walls were open and it looked out over a park.  Like a treehouse in the garden of the manor.  We had spilled something on the rug and I was trying to clean it up.  But it wouldn't come off.  In fact it had melted the plush shag carpet and had made a hole through to the next plush shag carpet.  There were about 2-3 feet of carpets.  Everytime someone new rented the place they just threw down another carpet.  The carpets alternated colors.  So there was a whole lot more vertical space that the room could have had if there had been only one carpet.  I started to dig down in the corner of the room but found out that the room was open to the apartment below and there was someone sleeping there so I stopped that.
</p>

<p>
Then I was looking out the window at the parklike area which I was high above.  Some cats started chasing some birds and making a lot of screaming noises.  So I picked up the binoculars that fortunately were near me and started looking up close.  I watched the birds flying.  Then a giant seal/penguin started flying around, right in my view through the binoculars.  It wasn't supposed to be able to fly, but it was flying.  It came up very very close and stuck its beak right in my binoculars.  You see, if I hadn't had the binoculars it would have seen my human face and been scared.  But with the binoculars it didn't know what I was.  Maybe I looked more like another penguin to it.  
</p>

<p>
It flew right up to the landing and stood about a foot or so away from where I was sitting.  We were just sitting there together being warm.  Then a lady came in, said the penguin couldn't be here and started leading it forcefully away by the hand/flipper/wing.  
</p>

<p>
I was in school, sitting at a table, tying my shoes.  A younger kid came up to me and &#x2013; as a joke &#x2013; took my shoe away.  Then they brought it back.  I said something to him.  An adult was there and said that I was being to harsh.

I had my old brother typerwriter hooked up to an old tape machine and I was using that as my desktop.  I was travelling in Lake Crystal with my family and I kept calling in to work with that.  Except that I kept sleeping so much and missing calls, even important calls.  I sat down to start to slog through my e-mail.  I was counting how many there were.  There were several piles of cakes and candy bars in the fridge and cupboard of the kitchen of 1377 and I kept sneaking these hoping no one would notice or mind.  
</p>

<p>
We were packing up to leave and I left this pile of equipment in the middle of the hall.  Someone came in and stole it.  I ran through all the rooms (it was mostly Leo's family) trying to find it to no avail.  I also spent some time searching through crowded deptartment stores.  I was very upset.  At least it gave me an excuse for missing work.   Finally Virginia &amp; Sandy came in and suggested that I go to the police and file a report.  I realized that this was a good idea, calmed down significantly  and set off to do so.

I snapped my fingers and it appeared under a tree.  I went into the paths down the hill next to the park trying to find a private place to smoke.  But there was too much traffic on the road that could see the path.  There were some ladies there around the trees at the bottom of the hill.  I started talking to them but then left back up to the inn near the park where I showed them how they could get water from one of the stalls for 5 cents.  One of the children gave 50 cents and went in because she was the daughter of the owners.

We were going into a place where you had to solve a bunch of problems to get out.  I had been there before.  The trick was that you had to go through the forward door.  This led you around outside and back to the same place and only then could you open the side door which was the goal.  I was with a different group of people this time and I was less confident that we could solve the problems.  We didn't have a generalist like Ken Allen.  Someone who didn't have specific deep skills but somehow catalyzed the skills of those around him to come up with a solution.

I went over to a coin operated machine that took a nickel.  I had a dime and I thought it might work.  Might give change.  But it just gave me back my dime.

One of the people who was with me came over and told me I couldn't do that; it was unethical.  So we took the coins and put them in the dishwasher for the owners to find.

There was a giant tower of electronic equipment sitting outside a building.  It was supposed to be receiving signals and producing an output but the output was garbled.  Dennis Fischbach had already hypothesized that it must be a baud rate issue.   I looked it over.  I was feeling sleepy and thought I could just wait for somebody else to solve it.  But then I hopped up and asked if we had the manuals for each of the pieces of equipment.  If so, then we could find the input and output of each and how the input and output baud rate get set.  We could then  trace where the baud rate was incorrect.  One of the people thought that was a great idea and ran off to get the manuals.

My father came in and said that he had just played a computer game using AI that used only 800 bytes and was amazing.  I expressed skepticism that a nontrivial game could be done in 800 bytes.  I explained that it didn't count as AI unless there was some kind of emergent behaviour; unless it knew or did something unexpected by the developer.  
</p>

<p>
We went down to look at it.  Jimmy Turnure and a couple others were sitting at a table next to a large picture window in a room like a rec room.  A laptop was open on the table and it showed a game with 8 bit graphics; decent, but old-fashioned.  I was skeptical that it really fit in 800 bytes or that it was really AI rather than regular programming.  
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Turnure had a game book.  I was trying to read the title.  It was called Then and Now.  The title was written in those funny gothic heavy metal letters so it was hard to read.  Every play had two aspects; the past and the present. So you would draw a card that had two cards on it, one for then and one for now.  There were &#x2013; as is common with these things &#x2013; a whole sequence of rule books and Jimmy was having a discussion with the player accross from him (on the same side of the table as me and my father) about the Then One rule book, which was the first extension.  
</p>

<p>
We started to play and I started to lay my cards down on the table in front of me as instructed.  The player accross from me, sitting next to Jimmy, started to criticise where I lay the cards.  I explainded that topologically they were layed out the same as the rest of the people, but they didn't buy that and I moved then into a more traditional arrangement.

She tried to piggyback on my card.  I knew they wouldn't let that happen and indeed, the cashier lady came over and stopped us.  Fortunately she didn't turn us away, she just made us pay the entrance.

There was a train that the enemy army was running and I was following it to keep track of it.  Every time it stopped, it was like different garages in an alley.  And people would walk around, both the residents of the neghborhood and the soldirs from the train.  I would sneak up to the next carriage of the train each time and write the next number on it so that we could tell how many train cars there were and what order they were in.  
</p>

<p>
There was all kinds of good stuff in the train cars like elecronic connectors, a knife with a rubber handle and warm winter clothing.  I thought about taking some of the stuff for my use but I couldn't be as stealthy carrying stuff like that just in case it came in useful.  
</p>

<p>
I went around to the front of the train car only to realize that I had finally got to train car #1 and the captain was coming around the corner the other way.  I managed to get away without them noticing me by pretending to be taking out two large bags of trash.  The garbage man was beneath their notice.  I went around some of the other train cars / apartments and threw the bags in a trash can then went off to make my report.  As I headed back down the alley where the train had parked I saw that all the of the numbers were out of order.   123, 234 ..  They had been rearranging the order of the train cards and so any efforts I had had to figure our their order were in vain.  The people in the alley agreed that yes, the numbers were all out of order.

We were in a game show.  You had to run on a treadmill for a while.  Like 15 minutes. Not particularly fast, either. Both contestants maxed out and did the full 15 minutes and so they had to have a speed challenge.  I suggested that they have a race against the hostess of the game show.  I felt up to running for 15 minutes.

Peter van Calligan was there and I had to go to the bathroom.  He pointed out that there was a narrow stairway leading down to the bathroom.  I went down and there were also many drinking fountains I was pleased to see.

A bunch of us kids sat around playing records.  45 RPM 7 inches, which I called 33s.  One was playing the head cleaning tape from the company and then it segued into Blondie's 'Denis' which I talked about.  Someone came in to tell us that dinner was ready.

There are the events that occur and the way you experience them.  The events are like many tiny litte blue dots on a white background.  The way you experience them is like bold blue lines that connect a small subset of those dots rectilinearly.  You can change the events or you can change your experience of them but you can't change both.  Since the only thing that matters in the end is the experience, you might as well change that.

I was going to work on the first day after the break.  I was planning to get there just in time to check on stuff and get ready for my first meeting.  I was taking the bus to work.  It was the bus along Snelling down the hill from Highland Park.  The road signs on the street lights that usually had the names of the cross streets intead had the names of the epics/tasks that we were supposed to be working on at any given point.  It was my responsibility to update them in the system and since I hadn't done anything over the break they were all blank.  That was one of the things I was planning on doing in between all the other things I had to do.  Each of them I knew how to do and was wanting to do but there were so many piled up on each other that they never got done.

<p>
I got to work and was trying to get something from the cafeteria, which was taking longer than normal.  Evenually I gave up.  Brad Ludwig came and led me to the place where the first meeting was.  The building was a cross between Mechanic arts and a victorian club.  We went to the hallway where the first meeting was and I was going to get ready for the meeting when I realized that I had forgotten my phone.  I had my laptop so I could present but I had forgotten my phone and kept rummaging through my backpack.

Trying to fly on a bicycle, pushing backwards in the queue past people, not enough manna to get off the ground.

<p>
Got to work and wanted to get a drink of water from the nice lady in the cafeteria but she was busy with something inside the kitchen.  I asked if I could take one of the glasses that was prepared; it was a dribble cup, warm and unsatisfying.  They had a bottle ready but I still didn't have my regular glass to drink it.  Everything took longer than it should have.
</p>

<p>
We were starting a new project and had created two new team rooms, one on the lower level.  We had also arranged to get two baby parakeets as mascots for the project and put one in each team room.  All the team members were very excited about the arrival of the mascots today.  In order to get the cage into the team room on the lower level, the maintenance men had to find the old keys.  They went out to look for them.  They opened a door underneath the cafeteria display case for me.  
</p>

<p>
Then the workers had to run an extension cord.  It accedentally wrapped around my ankle.  I started to get pulled up the stairs.  I shouted 'Health and safety!' but he didn't stop.  I shouted 'Health and safety critical!' and he still didn't stop.  So I shouted 'Health and saftey danger!' and I took out a knife and started hacking at the cord.
</p>

<p>
After it stopped I went on a tirade about him not adhering to health and safety and ignoring my plight.  I didn't really want to get him in trouble, I just wanted him to acknowledge, maybe even apologize.  But instead he doubled down that he was right and that I was wrong, because he had heard things from reliable sources.  Who were these reliable sources? Mimi Mingo (a girl who led a gossip campaign against me in grade school).  I said, Aha!  I am being unfairly judged on my past.  Alarm rang.

Woke up on the side of the U of M Mall, except a version that was running steeply downhill.  A beautiful young brunette was gazing into my eyes.  She walked off to go to class.  I ran after her to get something from her to prove that this wasn't just all a dream.  But she turned the corner and was gone.  Another short dark haired gentlemen was walking the other way and I stopped him to ask for something that could prove if this was a dream.

<p>
But then I realized that I was on a hill so all I had to do was try flying down the hill and if it worked then it was a dream.  I leaped down the hill, and while I did not exactly <i>fly</i> I more floated down to the bottom and landed on my feat.  I was able to conclude that it was in fact a dream.

We were going to a play.  Shakespeare.  Henry VIII.  We had a lot of extra stuff with us like clothing and bottles of cleaner and car oil. I was worried that stuff would get stolen so I went to take it back to the car to put it in the trunck.  By the time I did that it was too late to get back to the play and I couldn't remember the way anyway.  It was down a bunch of dirt roads in the forest.  I went to the corner but the road was flooded and I couldn't get through.  Gayatri would have been mad at me for getting my boots dirty.  I waited a while and suddenly the path was completely different.  It was dry and it went down where it hadn't before.  I started going along this.

I tried to use my phone but my phone had the wrong interface.  I realized that this is what the phone did when in <i>this</i> world.  The world called itself middle earth but it had nothing to do with Tolkein.  I had been there before, going the other direction.  It was a pleasant semi-rural country life with lots of little shops and cottages.  I stepped up some tables in a restaurant.  I kept trying to use my phone to get back to the play and then I suddenly realized.  If I could be here why would I want to go back to that world?

Getting off the train, I was the last one to make the connection and the door closed. I knew the town, we had been there before, you could see the big government hall over the stores in the city center.  In a small town in southern Minnesota.  Right over that hill was where we were going.  It was about a mile away.  So I decided to walk.  I would just get off at the next stop and walk.  I had my cell phone and I could call Gayatri and tell her where I was and use gps to get there if I couldn't remember the streets.
</p>

<p>
Another young black lady whom I had never met before also missed the connection and she asked if I could follow her.  I said sure, it was only a few blocks away and I was going to walk.  I then corrected myself and said it was more like a mile.  She confirmed that walking a mile was nothing for her.  We rang the bus to stop but the bus driver wouldn't stop for fewer than 4 separate rings so we couldn't get off until a couple of stops later and now we were even further from the destination.  We finally got down and started walking along the sidewalk.  I stared to look at my phone and the map started to figure out where I was.

I plugged it into the wall, put a blanket very neatly over the wall, hid under a blanket and flipped the switch with a pole in case there was an explosion.  Nothing happened.

We were driving down a major street.  I was driving and Gayatri was with me.  For some reason I had to drive backwards.  The brake wasn't working fully either. I was very afraid of hitting the other cars.  I had to look in the rear view mirror to see where I was going.  There was a car right in front of me but I didn't hit it.  Finally I had had enough and I pulled onto a side street.  It was a side street in Italy in the winter.  It turned out to be a dead end and I parked there.  Gayatri and I decided that we would move to Italy.  We sat there in a little area with some concrete benches.  Suddenly the whole place was filled with other people waiting there too.  The vast majority of them were African, and the lions' share of the remainder were eastern European.  These were the other people who were waiting to get in to Italy.

Then when he got to the intersection accross the Old Fort Road bridge, his semi jacknifed onto the porch of a house.  This had happened before.  We thought this would mean he would fail the test but
actually the damage was not as bad as it might have been, he was graded on points, and the number of points deducted brought his score to 95, which was the borderline score.  It meant that whether he passed or failed went to a decision of the judges.  But two of the judges were the guys from M*A*S*H and so they of course voted for him to pass.

So I went to search in the shelves for a larger container to cook it in.
</p>

<p>
Then I thought I would start putting some giant stuffed animals away.  To do this I had to go to the second level which was in a different dimension where the house went on to double its size.  I went up the trapdoor in the upstairs bedroom.

I delivered something on my bicycle to Watlow.  Brad Skillicorn was there, in the garage, stuck doing work on the oily floor.  I handed the item to them and took the reciept.  It was irregular and they may already have had everything they needed.

Then I continued bicycling along the street.  There was water in the street and the Galapagos turtles were migrating.  You could hear them saying so on the radio.  Boats were causing injury to the turtles so I slowed down on my bicycle so as not to harm them as they brushed past me.  I didn't like them touching me.

<p>
I rode my bicycle down some steps into the basement of a large bookstore.  There were a bunch of religous people there and they had very clear ideas about good and evil.  I didn't fit in so I rode on through.  As I opened the glass doors to exit the building and continue biking up the stairs one of the priests came out to talk to me.

I was in a meeting room and I was elaborating on the pros and cons of two different designs.  Then I went to the bathroom and was going in the urinal.  One of the attendees came up to me and was complaining that I was being too perfectionist.  I asked him if this could wait until I was done with going to the bathroom but he continued.

We were sitting in a hallway talking about different types of hallucinations with John Banks &amp; Jimmy Turnure.  What they were describing wasn't the same as my experience.  Which I was experiencing with the patterns on the floor at the time.  They said of course it was. I said how would you know? How do you know that what you experience in orgasm is the same as what others do?

Going to the fourth floor of the shopping center, I was able to fly easily.  I thought I could just keep flying so I went up to the fifth floor but then the manna ran out and I fell all the way back down to the ground, not hurting myself by grapping on some ropes.

We were leaving the hotel that day and I still hadn't packed and there was a bunch of left over chocolate cookie dough in the pans in the sink that I had to clean up.  We took mama and papa on a tour and we had to leave early to get back because we still had to pack.  The ceiling of the stairway got lower and lower until we couldn't go up anymore (although papa was able to crawl through the last one) so we went down a different corridor.  This was a long sequence of truck doors that we opened by tapping on a wall or floor button, like a game controller.  There started to be more and more packages in the way that we had to climb over as we went through the doors.  The packages got larger and larger and eventually they were electric pianos of various sizes.

I was talking to some other people in my college who I was taking a history class with.  They were commenting on the amount of reading assigned.  I hadnt actually done any significant amount of the reading but I said that it was usual for history classes to have the amount of reading assigned increase exponentially near the end of the class, at least for one class it had been that way for me.

<p>
We were supposed to re-enact some battle with legos.  The extent to which our legos were assembled was related to how much reading prep we had done, so in my case very little.  One of the other students declared he was attacking Alabama, which was me; I was pretty much the whole US.  I quickly grabbed a large long piece with trapezoidal windows in it that represented some of the US states including Alabama and put it into play.  He came over with his cobbled together pieces, and I broke them apart because wasn't that how you were supposed to play the game after all?  Apparently it was because I was considered to have won.

I was supposed to do some secret agent stuff.  This was going to be highly dangerous and would result in severe damage, many times the lethal amount.  But it was OK because they were going to give me 10 glasses of their special water every day.  So as long as I didn't experience a lethal dose within 2.4 hours I would be OK.  Or, if I only worked 12 hours a day, I could experience a lethal dose every 1.2 hours.  They gave me 2 glasses right then and there.

There were multiple roulette/craps tables each right adjacent to the other.  My target was sitting at one with a whole bunch of other people including a lady with a big blonde perm.

But then I overslept and I couldn't get up.  I was having trouble navigating the directory structure because I was using e-macs and it was a different interface like an old vaudeville theatre.  I had to keep going back to the top level directory and trying to find my way back down to my folders.

I went up to her apartment and adjusted the radio that she used for her kid.  The apartment was the upper bedrooms of 1377.  There was a better radio in the second bedroom.  I went there and had to lie down on the floor to adjust it.  She lay down next to me and kissed me.  I left, wondering how I was going to leave my current lover now that I had been unfaithful.

I was supposed to be fated to be chosen as the star of the play.  Dan Smith was in front of me in the audition.  Was he involved?  I went into the office of the lady who was deciding.  It was a fairly cramped, triangularly shaped office.  Lots of wood and a mixture of books and knick-knacks.  There was a dog on a bed in the room.  
</p>

<p>
She gave me a coin, a little larger than a quarter and stood there.  I asked if this was what I was supposed to do, to improvise something on the coin.  She confirmed that. I improvised about being a wizard and sacrificing the dog in order to imbue the coin with power so that it could be put in the mystical vending machine to recieve the golden pepsi.  She looked unimpressed, but said that I would be in the troop.  I was the last one and there weren't any more spaces, so I would have to stay in a storage area which was on the side.  I asked if it was cold.  She said yes, until about 10 PM because they kept opening the doors to get equipment.

I left to go get lunch but everyone else had the same idea.  The lines were long at the grocery store and they were even longer at the health food store.  One of the customers was asking one of the storekeepers why he worked there.  Because he had just gotten out of treatment and it was good therapy.  There was a movie like that apparently.

I was walking home from way in the north.  I was going to take the bus down Snelling but I got distracted and started walking toward Minneapolis.  I walked down dark streets at night in the city.  I had a lot of stuff in my pockets, like an extra set of jeans with a walkman in them.  I got to a T junction that I was familiar with; I had walked home from there before.  I turned and stared running up the hill. There were 3 strangers there, young men who were playing ball.  They bumped into me and said 'what are you doing tonight' in an intimidating way.  'Getting beat up, I guess.' I said and the let me alone.  They were making fun of the way I was running and trying to correct it.  
</p>

<p>
I ran to a big intersection, like University. I crossed the street half way and waited for the rest of the light on the boulevard.  But it turned out that I had actually stepped into a taxi.  I figured that I would just go one block and get out of the taxi and continue on my way with only a small detour.  But there was someone else in the taxi, a sleepy longhaired guy and he was going to a destination so I was stuck until we got there.  When we got there it was a large house with a metal gate on the driveway.  The taxi stopped and it was $20 and some change.  There was a whole family in the taxi. One of the kids gave the driver some change.  I didn't have a 10, only 20s so the sleepy guy gave me a 10 and I gave the driver a 20.  Therefore we had split the fare.  The driver tried to give me back the change but I insisted he keep it; smiles all around.  Then I tried to continue walking along my way.
</p>

<p>
Since I was a good ways away from my intended path, I was completely unfamiliar with the neighborhood and so was the guy who was with me.  I went into a room in a commercial building.  They were doing a class with about a dozen people.  I sat down with them.  They put a spray can that made all the phones not work with anything over the air.  This was supposed to be temporary, but when I went back outside, my phone was stuck on whatever screen.  I couldn't even get GPS to figure out how to take an uber to the nearest bus since it was now much too far away to get home.
</p>

<p>
I thought about how nice it would be, as I was running through a downtown area, with many large stone tall office buildings, to stay running all night and then just shower at the YMCA and show up for work in the morning.  But then that lifestyle would be just like having your own apartment with a treadmill.

People were all about the real Tolkien excavations that were going on way up in the hills where Tolkien was originally inspired about the Lord of the Rings.  We were in a party in 1377 and everyone was crowded into the living room.  Someone from Open School asked me if they were taking the real artifacts because he believed that he had them.  I said, becuase I had heard it on the radio, that you just had to go to where they were doing the excavations and they would take them back.  I had only been on mid-country roads that I pretended were Tolkien's area; not the real one which was way higher in the hills.

He was talking so much about it that I started to ask more pointed questions.  He said that they could continue for a couple more years with their current funding.

I should have been able to figure out where to put the wires by comparing the two taillights, but the exercise got progressively more complex until there were 5 wires instead of 3 and a whole circuit board in which to plug them.  I finally gave up and went in to ask the garage that we just happened to be parked outside of if they could fix it for me.

When they came in it was clear that they were eager to get me out of their office.  I sat down to tie my shoes and calmly explained to them about the optimization book.

I was trying to get extra sleep prior to an early morning at work.  But Gayatri came in 2 hours after I fell asleep to watch TV for 2 hours.  I was sleeping in the bathtub of 1377.  Then she went to the next room to take a shower and when that happened water leaked into the bathtub.  It was a little cold but I just took advantage of the opportunity.  I let the water go all the way up before letting it drain.  It drained more slowly than I expected.  Finally I decided to dunk my head completely under water.

In the dining room of 1377 playing music.  The young thin blonde girl leaned against me.  I thought that made us girlfriend &amp; boyfriend.  I played an autoharp-like instrument.  She was far on the other side of the room.  I still kept thinking about the older heavier brunette.  I thought maybe I should just go with that as that was where my heart was.  We were having a discussion and I was going to have to use formal mathematical language, defining terms etc. because otherwise you were making statements about statements and the grammar became ugly.

I was at work staring at small text and pictures on a screen.  Work was the math room at Linwood.  Someone came in and handed me the form they needed to get into the lab.  Normally it was a bunch of science questions, but Steve Larson had asked me to see this person so I had created a bunch of music questions, mostly by copying one part from some book and expecting the person who filled in the form to do counterpoint.  "You really pulled out all the stops on this" he said handing it to me. I couldn't remember what he was there for so I asked "How's Steve?"

I was in the west cluster in TK.  It was more like a factory.  More open.  Kishore was working on a new project and I started to try to build it to understand the problem and help out.  I kept taking on projects, realizing that they may be more than I could do, but I kept thinking that if I got enough time on my own I could do so much more.  The more I had to do, the more I needed to be away on my own.
</p>

<p>
I was on the floor, with the television, trying to work on the computer.  I eventually moved away from the television, but didn't turn the overhead light on.  I was trying to read the manual.  There was a problem that the system didn't work if you had less than 312k memory.  I could confirm this empirically and it was specified this way but I couldn't find the reference in the manual.  The boss was there in the hall but he didn't come over to me.
</p>

<p>
Vijaya said that he had a workaround for the problem.  I tried to understand whether his solution involved padding out the memory or making the logic more complex and compressing the memory.  He was thinking about it from a very low level and had even drawn circuit diagrams.  I was wondering how it would look in the code.

We were driving through a park.  There was a dog hanging from the tree (not hanged, but tied to a high branch).  We thought it was weird. We figured that it was either an individual who was trying  to scam whoever went to save the dog or a stunt by an animal rights group.  Then we saw many more such animals hanging from the trees so we realized that it was the latter.  We were like, 'don't stop to rescue them, you will get guilt tripped into adopting one'.

I pointed out that we needed to worry about it going around and around too in the 3rd dimension and hitting somebody.  They were all very glad that I had thought of that.

We were going to the fair.  We got on the bus and we had to buy special tickets.  This was on a street like Grand near Dale.  There was standing room only but Gayatri got me a seat next to her; she had had her coat there.  
</p>

<p>
When we got to the fair it was closing up.  We had to go accross a stream to get to the food vendor we wanted.  They didn't have the thing we wanted but Gayatri got something like mashed potatoes and gravy.  I wanted the french toast but never got it.  Or at least they had something like maple syrup.
</p>

<p>
I went looking through a snowy cave.  Everyone was closed but there was somebody who was still open.  He had lots of nozzles with all kinds of different beverages.  He said that he had splurged on them; it was kind of a hobby for him.  He asked if I wanted water, I said yes and he gave me a large large cup which I drank and it was very satisfying.

I was a senior so I could go do independent study like I always did; it was my choice.  But which choice was really better and would I regret not having the structured class?
</p>

<p>
I went to the mall and I thought about getting a job there.  I climbed up some stairs.  I was looking for the bathroom, which I knew was impossible to find.  The doors labelled men and women were just places to wait for the shuttle to the airport.  Why they were gender separated I didn't know.  You had to go into the door marked 'bear'.  It turned out that 'ghast' was 'bear' in some other language, and that was why I didn't find it.  I went in and finally there were seats where you could urinate.  I sat down even though it was near to this one lady at the front.  She wanted to examine me.  I told her that I was already going for a procedure so she didn't have to.  She smoked and gave blow jobs.

I wanted to get back home and take a shower so that I could either go to school or to work.

So I started walking up a hill along a busy street in the direction of home.

I was at a David Bryne concert.  This was in a large interior courtyard in a shopping center.   He wanted us to sing along to 'Life During Wartime'.  Everyone pulled the tables together and huddled under them.  He was doing something there.  I went around the tables in the center of the interior courtyard.  Then I was riding my bike through the rest of the shopping center and into the city.
</p>

<p>
Sandy and I went around the roundabout.  She was in her car and I was on my bicyle and she went into a different lane.  We were going down Lexington and I just had to follow Lexington all the way back.  Fortunately it was downhill most of the way and I was just floating/flying along.
</p>

<p>
It turned into a Hamline/Randolph neighborhood, somewhat gentrified and with new boutiques.  I was biking through the stores.  Thinking how this was America and it was different from Britain, even though it was only a 3k flight away.

I was riding my bike back to the bus stop.  I was floating; it was all downhill.  I realized that if I concentrated on pushing forward to the destination, I just got slower &amp; slower.  If I relaxed, opened up, and just felt what was going on in the journey, then I would float higher, allowing me to go over obstacles.

<p>
I went up to the branches of the trees, and then higher to level of the clouds.  In the clouds there appeared a mountain where the enlightended one lived and there I landed.

I had a batmobile with special powers parked in the parking lot.  I went to a dinner where they were having a party by the beach.  We were eating chocolates wrapped in gold foil shaped like mermaids.  You would eat her face and her breasts and her vagina in 3 separate pieces.  It was all very sadomasochistically-psychosexual.
</p>

<p>
This one gay guy wasn't welcome there so he came with me. When we got back to the parking lot the batmobile was all blasted out from explosions and fire.  But we climbed in anyway and started off. 
</p>

<p>
I went to eat in a restaurant and again there were gold foil flakes in the dish.  I brushed them off onto the floor.  Then told the waitress not to take them away.  So I was picking up tiny little pieces of gold from the crumbs.  
</p>

<p>
Some of them had fallen into the basement so I undid the electricity and the trapdoor and got everything out of the way so that I could look there too.  When I tried to turn on the light, it gave me a shock.  You can't use the light without connecting the electricity back up.  I went to try to do that, but the gap between the wall and the machine was too tight a squeeze to get through.  I knew when it starts to feel like sweaty in jeans its almost over.

I was trying to find a bathroom in an outdoor club.  There were a lot of people sitting all around on the balcony and whatnot.  I would have been uncomfortable pushing through the crowd but I had a place there so I felt it was alright.

<p>
I went outside and there was a big collision of shopping carts, which was definitely my fault.  The collision was mostly with this one lady, but this one other guy who just happened to be there ended up in the gutter, with a shopping cart over his head, and water running over him.  The water was covering the baby that he was carrying and he was unconscious.  Would we be able to rescue her in time?  By the time I got there the waters had receeded and the baby was a little flower growing on his toe.  Or a fungus, or a fabric construction.

When I went outside I had had a call from Sally and she needed a certain Word document <i>right now!</i>  I asked the people in the room, which was now the dining room of 1377, if they wanted to hear me yelling at my ex, because that might be happening very soon.  I was going to yell at her for every time I went away for a little bit she suddenly had an emergency that needed my attention.  My phone had been reset and was very basic so I didn't have her number but I could dial.

We remembered the phone number (&#x2026;) &#x2026;-3116  but the buttons on my phone were plastic squares that had moved around so I accidently dialed -3114 even after a couple of tries.

I had to get to Highland Park High School by 1:00 to be at the first day of class so that I could finish my high school diploma.  I was a little late, it was almost 1:00 and I had just been dropped off by the bus.  I had to walk over a concrete sidewalk bridge that sloped steeply upwards.  
</p>

<p>
But I took a wrong turn on foot and went past the turn off where I should have gone over the street.  Now I was split and was a separate me, in a car along the street.  I needed to drive past and meet my other me who had taken the wrong turn and take them back by car.  But I couldn't find the path to get from the street to the sidewalk where I would have been.  I tried to look at the map on my phone but even that was cloudy.
</p>

<p>
Then someone was driving me along the Jefferson avenue hill of the mind, where in so many other dreams I had searched for things in the tall grasses.  They turned on Snelling and stopped in a parking lot.  Someone asked me why I even needed the High School diploma when I had like 2 Ph.D. (sort of). They also pointed out that my sweater &#x2013; which looked like a girls sweater &#x2013; was tucked in funny and torn in several places.
</p>

<p>
Then I had to go downtown back the other direction on the Jefferson avenue of the mind.  I was supposed to go into where my wife worked.  They allowed family, but I also worked there.  There were very specific rules about who could be let in.
</p>

<p>
I got in the front door and some teachers were leading a bunch of elementary school children in some kind of drama exercise.  The lady who let me in asked me if I also worked with the clowns.  This was apparently a training exercise for being a clown.  I said no, I worked in IT and pointed to the other building.  
</p>

<p>
I realized that it would have been easier to get in if I had remembered my own badge, but I hadn't, so I would have to go with the family member access.  I started walking along the hallways.  Some of the others came past me the other direction and there were words on the floor describing the difficulty I might have getting in.  'Format' or something like that.  The hallways got narrower and narrower and more difficult to get through as I went further back in the building.

I was sleeping and I couldn't wake up.  I was holding my hand in front of my eyes, but I still didn't see it because I was dreaming.  So if you are dreaming, why don't you wish for something?  I got a little doll of a tall busty blone in a wedding dress.  It came apart down the middle and was held together with magnets.  Then I was with a girl in a black dress.  I got blood on it, and she started to clean it off.  I offered to pay for it.  She said why don't we meet later.

Dennis Fischbach and I were driving in a car.  But nobody else wanted to come.  I wondered if it was because of me, so I asked him to drop me off in a park that was just ahead.  I would wait.  There was a bus stop with one seat, and a larger one where a lady was waiting.  There was snow on the ground and on the streets.  The park comprised one city block southwest of 35 on the way to TK.

<p>
We were trying to get markers that wrote on the whiteboards.  All the good ones were dried up and I couldn't get any of the others to work. There was some kind of inky/sandy substance but I didn't want to just smear it with my fingers.  The other guy wanted to use something digital and I wanted to use the actual whiteboard.

There were two girls and I had crushes on both of them.  I would happily have taken the dark girl, she made me feel all naughty. When I kissed her I decided that I would have to tell the light girl.  But I didn't want to because I wasn't sure it was a long-term relationship.  But then the light girl came over and kissed me and I felt so blissful I wanted to tell the dark girl that I couldn't see her but I was afraid to do so because I wasn't sure it was a long-term relationship..

We were at a club with John Banks and Dan Smith.  They went into another room to play poker.  The cards were decorated with pornography, lots of pictures of girls with cum all over them.  The police raided and we had to hide all the cards.  And hope that our girlfriends never found out.
</p>

<p>
I was with Norma, and John had a younger sister, younger than Kirsten.  I asked why we had never seen her before.  Norma gave a long winded explanation but the upshot of it was that she had been living with her father.

I was going to see a girl from school, but first I had to do a couple of things, some homework and going to see Dan Smith.  These took so long that it was too late to see her.  So I left from the building we were in, some old state building kind of thing with a lot of marble and tall ceilings.  I called her on my cell phone.  Of course the contacts didn't work but eventually I got the regular dial to work.  It worked like the tines on a music box.  The call went out and it came back in the rain.  Rain came through the trees to where I was.  Then it connected.  She said she was glad I called.  I took that as she wasn't mad at me.  I took a deep inerest in her craft projects and we agreed to meet over the weekend.

I was playing a card game with Trent, but I kept falling asleep and so I couldn't possibly win.  Which I tried to point out was a logical failure with the game but then admitted it was only a logical failure with the game if someone kept falling asleep during the game.

<p>
We were in a business where they had a gym and everyone was expected to go to the gym. They were kind of obnoxious when you went there and you weren't all fit.  I was sarcastic back to them.  
</p>

<p>
Then everyone was gone.  Where did they go?  Only strangers were walking through the halls.  I went looking for people I knew.

The Prisoner was following the enemy agents.  They were getting on a boat so he had to get on it with them.  The only way to find out what they were doing.  But first he went under and poked a small hole in it so that there would be a leak that would only affect them once they were out at sea.  All part of his plan.  Then he sat by the side and waited.

I was near the University and I was trying to get home.  There were a bunch of shops that had food but I didn't like any of them.  I walked along the street and saw a church on fire.  I stopped to take a picture of it to send to Gayatri.  I had a smart watch and was trying to get it to work properly.  I found one of her makeup articles.  It had makeup of a couple different kinds oozing out of it.  I put it to my skin and released some pus or other fluid.  I felt much better after that.  I wondered how I was going to explain this to her.
</p>

<p>
I was in a 3D simulation where you could see the layout of London, beneath the trees and beneath the water. There was a wooden foot bridge with high sides that spun around.  This led down accross the main square and then along to the most populated sections of town.  I sat on it as it spun around and let myself be amazed that this was the main straight line that had persisted for centuries and wondered which direction it pointed.

Came down to the living Room.  Gayatri and I were going out.  But then I said something and she got upset and started going on about me.  I thought about stabbing myself with a pencil again but left.

Then I was on the streets of New York, between two dogs, trying to sleep.  I didn't like the dogs but they liked me.

<p>
I was working on my computer in my bedroom.  I was remembering where some old files were.  There were lots of bed clothes and audio gear.  It was a 70's teenage room all over again.  
</p>

<p>
When I went out I saw that Babaka had knocked on the door.  But I hadn't heard anything.  She had knocked on the door because Trent was there.  I went into another bedroom to try to get some more rest before starting our day since I had been staying up very late on the computer.

I was on the stairs to the bathroom in 1377.  There was a young girl who was visiting us, maybe the younger daughter of the Sheers (except def not Miranda, maybe a fictious even younger sister).  
</p>

<p>
Dennis was in the bedroom, Leila was at the landing below.  I was sitting at the top of the stairs and the young girl was standing in the middle of the stairs.  
</p>

<p>
The young girl was doing some homework on URL and QR codes.  She and Dennis talked about how there were actually 2 other kinds of XRL that were originally intended to be used for technical purposes but which were now almost completely unknown because people just used URL/URI for that.
</p>

<p>
The young girl asked a question about QR codes and Leila answered.  I thought that she had missed the point and made it more complicated, so I started to explain from my point of view.  Leila pointedly shut me up, so I left and went to the bathroom.
</p>

<p>
Then I heard that I had been too forward.  I was incredulous and started to complain that this was impossible as I hadn't even finished a complete sentence &#x2013; I was the one who had been insulted by being shut up.  
</p>

<p>
Dennis came over and explained by way of telling a story about one time when he was younger, he had been accused of the same thing even though he had just been standing there and there was nothing he could do about it.  So I didn't complain.

When my mom came in she said something that upset me, so I walked out the door without taking keys, money or phone.  I thought to myself that I was a man grown, I really should have a better plan if I wanted to leave home.

We were moving into an apartment which was in an office building.  The office building was owned by the CEO of the company and the apartment had been owned by one of the partners.  It was one of these modern offices with lots of team spaces and curved walls and sales exhibits.  
</p>

<p>
There were a lot of sophisticaed electronic locks, doors and elevators to get into the apartment.   Also shallow pools that you were in danger of falling in if you were to walk in a straight line between the doors in the dark, say.
</p>

<p>
There was a front yard with a lawn.  You passed through a gate to get into a courtyard.  There were keys but I also had an RFID that allowed all the doors to just open as I came up to them.  The first time I went through the owner opened everything with a physical key but when I went back on my own later I just let them open.  
</p>

<p>
In the courtyard was a pool.  There was a regular door and a large gate as well.  I closed the gate so people couldn't see inside.  When you closed the gate it started raining in the courtyard.  I thought that was a really nice effect.
</p>

<p>
You had to take an elevator from the courtyard and the elevator was shaped funny.  I was worried that it would crush my head as it went up.  
</p>

<p>
Some people were visiting us at the apartment to help us move in, including a cute blond.  As they were all leaving, my wife left too , because she needed to buy some makeup.  She and the blonde rode away on their bicycles and as they left the blonde turned around to look back at me.  I thought "There are my two favorite people in the world."  Somehow there was an expectation that I would end up living with them both.
</p>

<p>
I turned and went back into the house.  I tried to get to the apartment but there was a class going on in the auditorium that you had to pass through to get to the front door.

We had to drop someone off from the bus at a store.  The bus stopped especially for them.  This was the second time we had done it.  The driver, who we knew, drove way past the spot and then backed up.  The person who was being dropped off started explaining how to get there but the driver was like, I can just eyeball it, I have done this before.  She was explaining, 'left, right, left' and so I started making a joke that because the driver was looking in the mirror that would be 'right, left, right' and they were all 'hey lets not confuse things.'

I was sleeping in a single bed in a large room.  Two ladies came home early and asked why the sheets were in the dishwasher.  I had apparently put them there instead of the washing mashine.  I hadn't finished the work because I hadn't expected them home so early.

There was an alien species that had great power over humans, but there was one guy who defeated them, mostly because of mistakes made by the alien that captured him.

I was in a hallway in a hospital type area and the humans who were the slaves of the aliens were leading me along.  They were talking with great relish about drinking your own blood and eating your own arms.

I had a medical appointment.  To get your heart measured you had to put your foot in this metal clamp that held all 5 toes.  My toes wouldn't fit, especially the pinky toe.  There was also a toad in there and part of the test was to see if it was happy.
</p>

<p>
We were sitting in the hallway, we were telling stories.  I had two stories in mind, one was about how the people there had kidnapped me while I was on my way to see my boyfriend Jessica.  I figured the homoeroticism would give the story verisimilitude.  I got the other story all prepared and this involved setting up a large banquet of pancakes and french toast.  When it came my time to speak, I vacillated between telling the regular story with the french toast or the story with a twist about being kidnapped.  I finally decided to tell the store about being kidnapped, but I couldn't remember it very well and everyone had moved around to different rooms so it wasn't as impactful.

Collected all my things.  Went to the top of the Disney tower.  I needed to find an elephant and it was unclear if it was to be found at the top or the bottom of the tower.  I left my things on the ledge.  When I swooped them up, one fell off.  It was an unimaginably long way down.  It was only my ear buds that were lost, none of my other keys, wallet, phone.

We went to the bottom of the tower and started to ask how we could search.  They said it wasn't certain but we could try and it would depend on the strength of your magic.  I was running down the highway with a pet.

We were in a Star Wars movie and the planet had continuous fireworks because they liked it that way.  They were doing a remake of the Lord of The Rings and they got to the preachy part where the hero was about to defeat the villian and the villian got to do a long winded tirade against the oppressive authority that had led him to rebel.

I was back in an old company (Zycad-esque) but given a chance to visit.  I was trying to boot up my computer.  Then someone came in with a new computer that was like 3 generations later, much bigger and more powerful.  I started to plug it in and plug in some monitors.  But I didn't want to put in the admin password.  Finally the guy came to set up the admin password.  There were two fields.  Something like   GURU H.  June 12a. It was supposed to be a dig on sombody but I didn't see how 'guru' was a dig.

Trent asked about them and I told him that they were really just SGI workstations, or the ones made now by the company that bought SGI then.

We were just arrived and unpacking.  There were many of us in the family and we had many rooms piled with suitcases and loose clothing.  Before we slept they were just placed on the floor.  But in the morning the ladies had put everything away.  So now I didn't know where anything was.  I was looking for a tee-shirt but couldn't find one so finally just grabbed one that still had the tag on.  
</p>

<p>
I went to a new company, it was an embedded electronics company, they made distributed devices.  I was touring the lab.  This one guy was explaining stuff and I was asking questions.  Then he said that if you wanted to know we had to do a thing.  And then he put a big hood over us both.  I made a joke about it being the cone of silence from Get Smart.  He walked us to another room, him forward and me backward with the hood over our heads.  But then I lost him in the crowd and was wandering around the cafeteria.

<p>
Everytime I asked a question I didn't get the answer I was looking for, people went off on tangents.  Nick was one of them and I was asking about the architecture of the system and the various components.  He pulled out a very detailed presentation and started going through it.

On an island.  There were two sides of the Island.  On one side were the rich white tourists and on the other the poor black natives.  I took a car over to the other side.  It was very different.  There were fewer houses, but they were bigger.  There were fewer trucks on the road but they were bigger.  And they didn't look out for you; I nearly got ran over.
</p>

<p>
I went back toward the tourist side of the island.  The driver of the van I was in drove along the side of a hill near a shopping area where the road was barely big enough for one pair of wheels.  I tumbled out of the car.  I went to a grocery store and started looking for soy milk and orange juice.  They were selling vanilla from behind the counter.  I picked up some spices but put them back down again.  When I found where the juice &amp; milk was they were on a high shelf and you had to ask someone to get them for you.  By then they had turned the lights down because the store was closing so I left.

I was going to school.  Except that I was going to two different schools.  Except that I was also able to do some work from home. 
</p>

<p>
The first school was like the U of M except that it was a bigger Open School Linwood.  I took the bus from one to the other, which was like Macalester, except that it was an elementary school.  I was very excited to get back to working on two projects.  One was a way to do testing for 'True North.  True north was the direction we were supposed to be going, as per the official policy.  I had an argument on the bus with two other ladies about whether North was the corporate direction and East was the personal direction or vice-versa.  
</p>

<p>
Anyway, you should be grading tests based on the accuracy with which one represents with fidelity the corporate policy, not injecting personal opinion into this.  This suddenly made everything clear and easy.  
</p>

<p>
I got the bus to drop me back off at home (1377) and I wanted to get started right away on writing this up.  First I needed some cold water so I ran to the fridge to get it but one of Gayatri's younger cousin's was already there and had just finished it without replacing it so I yelled at him for that.  I thought it would start a whole incident but he seemed to think it normal.
</p>

<p>
I went way up in to the third floor where there were some abandoned classrooms and started to set up a desk and my old mechanical cursive typerwriter.  I got all my notes together, and a large collection of pencils.  
</p>

<p>
Then I decided that this would be better set up in the basement so I packed everything up to go down there.  I met my father on the stairs while I was going down, he was also coming up to set up some of his own researches in one of the other rooms up there.

We were going into a dungeon that was like a town, like a fair, all sloping downwards and made of stone.  We went along until we came to a stop.  There was another group who was competing with us to get their first.  I broke off and jumped over the wall at the end.  They all told me I was wasting my time because the map we had seen at the beginning showed that there was nothing there.  I crawled along the edge of the steeply sloping wall back to where I could see the other levels of the town.  We had only been on the surface of it and it went deep into the side of the hill with apartments, shops and so on.  I crawled all the way to the courtyard of the largest house in town.  There was a bunch of alcohol bottles there near the window where I could grab them.  I thought this may be the clue to solve the mystery.  I could see that the guardian of the place was watching so I called him out and asked him for some of the alcohol.  He was very pleased that I hadn't just tried to take a bottle (he would easily have been able to stop me) and happily gave me a spoonful.  I asked if I could have the whole bottle because I needed it for the adventure, and he was all like, why would you want a bottle that can only bring you sorrow when you can have a spoonful that will bring you joy?  We sat down in the living room to discuss further.
</p>

<p>
At that point the other team came in, it turned out that the father of the leader of the other team was a military leader in this town.  They saw the glass of alcohol that we had, which was forbidden, but the guardian covered for me and said it was his; he was allowed because of age and status.

I went around and I had to outsmart the people responsible.  Finally I came back into the store front from the rear and snuck up on the ring leader.  He took out a gun and was going to kill me.  But first he explained that the gun turned people into those kind of dogs.  He asked why I was there and I told him that I was a plant for competitor company.  Then I called out and the feds came in.  They were all ladies and all dressed in white, because they expected to have to be in disguise.  But they had already been figured out.

Was checking into a hotel in a third world country, like Uzbekistan.  My room was like a corner of the lobby.  I had 56k in cash that I was carrying with me.  I didn't want to get robbed, so I pretended to put it in a glasses case that I could take to the safe to be seen putting it into the safe so that anyone watching wouldn't think I had it on me.  I kept trying to find the right objects to put it so that it couldn't easily be seen that it wasn't cash inside.  Some paper, some metal objects.  I could never find the same object twice in my suitcase.  Finally I gave up on the idea because I knew it was going to take too long.

There was a haunted house.  The only way to get there was to drive a car through the wall and then walk along a stone hallway.  The owner was leading a man and a woman there.  They finally came to the main door that entered the haunted room.

Sitting in the back bedroom in 1377.  I was waiting for my production run to be done.  Then I thought that I couldn't wait, I needed communication.  I rejected the television and was turning on the radio when I booted up my laptop.  I had missed the whole morning including 2 of my own meetings but I figured that I could make it up.  Someone had sent paperback science fiction books in the e-mail. I started to collect them in boxes to give them back to whoever sent them, since they were apparently sent to me in error.  I wondered if when you sent it via e-mail, the whole thing copied or just the covers.  The physical books appeared in the drawers of a writing desk.  This was on the top of a pile of junk which was in my room on Argyle.

There was a lot of furniture and boxes and clothes piled up and I wasn't certain how everything would fit.  There was going to be a lot of heavy lifting and we were late but we got started.

I came in late to work at Thermo King, which was in the bedroom of 1377.  I didn't think I had much that I needed to do that day, but then new work started getting added. My computer was my system 76 gazelle and it had an older version of the OS.  I was hoping no one would notice.  I had my charger, but didn't have the US to UK adaptor and I was worried that I would run out of battery.

<p>
My boss came in and said that there was a new PMO form where we added up all the costs for each project, each quarter.  It was a simple idea and it made sense.  He asked me to put a spreadsheet to start getting the data.  I started to create the spreadsheet.  It was hard to find the right cells because the older software had a warm woody textured background.  Then we got an e-mail that said the PMO had already started that, which called into question the need for me to do it.

But then I had to go to the bathroom, so I went through the cafeteria tyring to find it.  I went outside.  It was far away accross a snowy field and past a fence.  When I went past the fence, something dark and hairy grabbed at me.  I was afraid so I struck out at it.  But it turned out to be a small child, which started running after me.  Then everybody saw that I had struck at the young child so they all started chasing me.  So I tried to piss on the young child to deter it.

We were at the top of a snowy mountain.  Lots of wet snow.  We were going from somewhere in Iowa up to Minneapolis.  We had to go along the road and there was a map of the interstates we were travelling on.  We were stopped about halfway to rest.  Ahead of us was a large lake that the road went to the side of before it turned north.  We sled down the hill and then along the slushy river.  I was in front.  I put my feet forward to avoid any rocks.  As we came to the lake, there was a giant squid like creature with hundreds of tentacles that reached out from the center of the lake to the edges. We tried breaking past all the tentacles with the force of our momentum.

I was going to be playing piano in a concert.  I was trying to remember the songs I used to play.  They involved banging heavy chords, but when I was practising I kept missing the notes.  I used to be able to play it.  I wondered if I should cancel but I thought I would go through with it.
</p>

<p>
I was out on a ledge on a high cliff.  The grass and dirt crumbled under me and I was just barely hanging on.  I was able to pull myself up by getting my foot over the edge.  Then I climbed back through the window.

<p>
I found a guitar lying in a case.  I knew it was a magic guitar.  I took a pick that was there. I started walking down the stairs that went in a spiral around a center courtyard.  I was able to start playing an old Beatles Lennon song with just a few chords and it sounded perfect.  Then the owner of the guitar came out of one of the rooms and I gave it back to him.

We were in 1377 and some girls were coming over to a party.  Papa and Gayatri were in the kitchen.  Papa was concerned that he was running out of coffee.  Tension was increasing.  Tempers were getting frayed.  The coffee container had two compartments and I saw a bunch of coffee in the lower compartment, which hadn't been opened yet.  Gayatri threw them away and I went into the trash to look for them, thinking that I could open the second compartment for him.  But when I did I couldn't find them.  At this point everything calmed down.  I offered to go to the store to pick up some more coffee even though they were only going to be here a couple more days.
</p>

<p>
I went back into the living room and all the girls were clustered around papa as he told them stories.  There was a table that was broken and loose.  The top attached to a pole and spun around, but was half broken off.  I had to spin it back to get it stable.

I was in a tall apartment building and I was thinking about getting out a tobacco pipe that was hidden in one of the cabinets.

There was an event down at the University and I was supposed to be helping to coordinate it.  I managed to log on to the university computer and schedule the music to go along with the planned schedule of speeches.  I only had to hope that the speeches went on at the appointed time.

I was driving around and I was able to listen to the event but I had to open a separate window to a microphone where the event was, so if I closed the window I would lose the connection.

I was back in open school and I was supposed to be in a class.  I had my notes but I couldn't get them organized.  The note related to the event also.  I walked past some classrooms where maybe I was supposed to be.  I walked past the lunch where people were milling about and eating pie.  I figured I shouldn't take the food if I wasn't going to the class.

There was a man who wanted to have his face redone.  This involved lazers, a trapeeze and a motorcycle.  We were sitting in the living room of 1377.  I got tired of them talking about it and tried to talk him out of it.  I saw that he had only one eye.

I was in the bedroom of 1377 trying to get some sleep because I had to go accross the lake in the north in the morning.  It was already late and I wasn't sure if I would get enough sleep.  I wasn't sure if I should go there, come back again and go there, or just go there in the morning.  I wasn't sure if I should try to swim accross the lake once I got there.  There was a girl who was a very strong swimmer, I knew she could do it, but I wasn't sure I could.

<p>
The neighbor boy was playing the electric guitar right outside my window and this also made me unsure if I could sleep.

It turned out he was the one I was going to see at the lake up north.  I got in the car and started driving up Snelling, about as far as Cheapo Records, where there was a warehouse which was like the basement of 1377.  I went in and another &#x2013; maybe Pablo or Dan Smith &#x2013; was there and we started to try to put together music equipment.

I knew there was someplace like that in this mall but I counldn't find it.  I went to a food court but it was closing and I didn't want the donuts there.  I started leading the little girl to the other side of the mall.  We passed through a bookstore but they didn't have any coffee or food there.  We went on to the other food court but it only had lunch items.  I gave up and started to lead the little child away.  She was starting to get cranky and I apologized to her.

They had a litle alleyway with shops and big orange signs pointing you there.

We went and sat in the parking garage.  I hoped to just stay there, but they were having us walk in a line. I looked at the line of people from the second floor building.  Some were walking through the water of a swimming pool and some were just walking on the sidewalk alongside.

So I flew, by swinging along some tree branches, crashing threw the window of a house, into a large living room where a family was sleeping, waking them up.

Packing up to leave for a college in America.  I was late applying, so I didn't have a cabin on the ship, I just had something like a parking space.  All my stuff seemed to fill more than one parking space and I wondered what was going to happen if they said someone else was in the others.  It was #113.
</p>

<p>
When we got there we were setting up.  I didn't know where any of my stuff was, so I walked out without money, wallet, phone, keys.  I didn't know what I would do in America without any of these things, so I turned around and went back to the dock to see if I could get my stuff.  Of course they wouldn't let me back in and I had to stay outside of security in a booth where people drove past.
</p>

<p>
When we finally got to the apartment, everyone was helping me bring stuff in.  I had more vinyls than I thought and we started playing some on one of Leo's old record players.  I helped father carry a dolly up the stairs and then the workmen came with another crate.

I was in a hallway studying for my thesis.  I didn't know what to study and was being aimless.  Then I picked a book that my thesis advisor had given me and started looking at one of the simpler equations from the begining.  I thought this would be a good place to start; I could just go deep here.
</p>

<p>
I was looking through some other books that I had, including one from a Russian author whose initials were E. E. E.  I found a twenty dollar bill in it and set the bill out in the open.  Someone else and I were looking through a whole bunch of papers and clothes to see if we could find anything else.  The $20 bill disappeared.

I finally couldn't drive it any more and pulled over in a parking lot.  There was a large hill there that I was able to drive up to lose momentum.  I thought maybe the brakes were working a little and maybe the car just needed brake fluid. There was a garage right next to the parking lot.  Gayatri wanted to go somewhere cheaper but I figured that since this was right here we might as well just go to him even if he was more expensive so I started talking to him.  He was dealing with another customer and then started looking at my engine.

Running through a field by some train tracks.  There was a dog who started complaining about how she was treated by her master, who came accross as real trailer trash.  I snuck open the door from the doghouse outside to his kitchen and let the dogs sneak in.  There was another two of them and they were talking about how they did in school.  We all met on the porch to hash out the issues, but the original girl dog didn't bring up her concerns and I didn't either for fear of speaking out of place.  There was an implication that I was only raising these issues because I had a crush on the girl, which I didn't try to deny.

I had to move some ice away from the rocks to be able to get to where the pianos were.
There were several of us crawling around on the rocks.
These were the pianos used by the Beatles.
The theory was that their unique sound was caused by a certain fungus on the pianos.
I crawled accross the top of pianos after I had cleared away the ice to get to them.
I didn't find any evidence of any fungus having any effect.
I got to the other side of the pianos and it was a light room with wooden flooring, lots of wooden shelving and many crates and boxes piled up along the wall.
I had to announce verbally, loudly and clearly, to the people still sitting on the rocks that were on the other side of the room,
"Paul McCartey was right and I was wrong.
The Beatles' unique sound was not caused by the fungus on the piano, but rather the unique curvature of wooden slats on the floor of the Abbey Road studio."
John Lennon was one of the people sitting on the rocks, and he said,
"What about the unique resonance of the drums?"
We had to conclude only that this experiment showed no evidence in favor of the piano fungus theory and no evidence against the floor board curvature theory.

I was sitting next to a project manager
and he was explaining to
one of the team members
what they should do.
And I thought
that I wasn't a
very good
project manager.
I would never
have told the guy
how to do his job.
Maybe I should
seque into doing
something more
creative/authoring/designly.
</p>

<p>
I was back at TK
and the office was dark
and they had put up extra
cubicle walls.
</p>

<p>
I tried to find my old desk
but they had moved it
and there was just a
rack of computers
with interns all around.
You couldn't actually sit down
there, there wasn't
enough room.
They weren't planning
for other than working
from home
and
it wasn't even convenient
to do other than
work from home.
I figured I would
just go
work from home.

I was going to give a talk.
This time I was prepared for it
but I wasn't sure about the content
It was all about Jesus
and it was Easter
but not in a preachy way.
I was eating an omlette from the pan
and fruit salad mixed in
getting ready to go.
Also a smoothie in a blender
all in the kithen of 1377.
</p>

<p>
When I went there, I flew.
I flew so strongly,
flying over ropes a meter
above the ground.
But then the castle was
supremely tall
and the wind blew down
from the top with
the force of a storm.
I stopped being able to fly
when I started to try to get
in the building.
Some people were there
and they tried to help me
by building little orange snowmen
that I could practice flying over
to get inside.
But the door was too small
and I couldn't make it
very far inside the building.

I was explaining economics to someone.
How government direct payments
to consumers would boost the economy.
They were getting philosophical
about how you couldn't know
everything about the economy.
I was like, you couldn't know
everything about the Andromeda galaxy
either, but that doesn't stop one
from reasoning about it
as a whole.

I flew into an area of a school
that was filled with water.
I went diving down into the water
and then just barely made it on to a
ledge that was numbered.
Along the ledge and I
was flying through a college for
computer security.
It looked like there were some
fun challenges and safes to
break into
but everyone there looked
so much more
knowledgable and dedicated
than me,
I didn't want to seem to be
messing around, which is all
I would be doing.
</p>

<p>
My whole family was packing up and leaving.
My mother had arranged the journey for
later in the day.
I thought that it was a little ambitious
because we still had to move the second mattress.
I bicycled with Trent down to the dry cleaners
to pick up the mattress so that it would be
ready for the movers.
I told him he could wait and didn't need to come in.
They said that it would be ready in a few minutes
and I could wait.
How I was going to get a mattress back home on
my bicycle I am not sure.
I tried to call Emily and although my phone was
working, I didn't have her number stored.
</p>

<p>
We were all trying to meet back at the parking
lot after a show or event.
I drove some of us in a little car, trying to
meet where the rest were.
They were off in a little island surrounded by
shallow water.
We were then going to drive the big car to
the front and get a taxi home.
But when we arrived, the children had turned
into cardboard.
I knew that it would take forever in the dream
to undo this and would never really be right,
so I told the other adults that I couldn't do
this night stuff anymore and had to go back to
the day things.
The day things were at 1377.
I left them and said I would try to help them
again in the night.
I started running back to 1377.
It was uphill but I had a lot of energy for running.
I even had a down coat, which I didn't really need;
I started to get a little warm.
I wondered if I had my pipe in my pocket and if
I could pick up some tobacco on the way home.

There was a song that went with it.
And to do the tune of the song
we flew along.
Through houses and along roads.
There was a fair selling soda and popcorn.
Musibau was on Albert street, looking for a project
to make some money.
We had lots of old pottery and stuff piled
on shelves like in a craft store.
He picked one up but it was only worth
four pounds so he thought maybe it
wasn't worth fixing.
</p>

<p>
Someone was recommending a job for me.
It was the dentist.
He told me to just go down to the
nearby roads in the suburbs
and get a job selling in
one of the stores.
I thought that was beneath me.
I asked how much it would pay.
He said 30-40k/year.
Which was actually pretty good.
I asked if it required a college degree.
He said no.
I walked off to find something better.

I had to identify as the owner of a

Then there was a song.
I didn't remember any of my lines;
I thought I just had to follow along.
There was a song, with John Banks.
It was to the tune of
a song I wrote as a child:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
There is a plauge upon the land
The soldier said as he raised his hand
A million people or more shall die
Ere we see the sun comin' through the sky
There is a plauge upon the land
</p>

<p>
There is a chill in the air tonight
The poet said as he drank his wine
Then he took a look outside
He'll not wake up in the morning light
There is a plauge upon the land
</p>

<p>
Comin' from accross the sea
Like an evil killing hand
Spreading sickness and disease
There is a plauge upon the land

I went down to lake Michigan.
The waters had been too cold to
go in in the morning but they had
warmed up a little by now.

<p>
The lake came right up to the street

I started wading in and it felt

I started playing with the moss
that covered the sand.

There were sea creatures there
they were humanoid.
I started to record one with
video on my phone.
The creature/old-man took my phone
and recorded something with it
in a language I couldn't understand.
I thought that the video wouldn't play
but it did.
I had to restart the phone
because another, unwanted, program
had taken over (again), but the
recordings were still there.

I started to be able to understand

I was trying to get home.
I had 2 bicycles,
a large quantity of groceries
and some frozen items.
I was going to stop at
a rental company
and split it into 3 delveries.
The guy from the rental company
helped me park.
I started taking out the bicycles
and realized that I was doing it
only to put them back.
So I changed my mind and decided to
take them all in one trip.
I thanked the guy from the rental company,
told him that I had changed my mind
and that I would no longer be
needing the rental cars.
I made an extra point about
how much I valued their services
to try to soften any disappointment
that I wasn't using them now.
</p>

<p>
I drove away.
The car became a bicycle, with 2
balls that rotated at the bottom
of each tire.
The balls looked like ear buds.
The tires didn't rotate;
the balls at the bottom did.
Navigation was very smooth
at least while I was going downhill.
</p>

<p>
Eventually the bike degraded and
I was just holding the ear bud
ball rollers on the bottom of a
cylindrical metal bar.
</p>

<p>
I was going uphill and I didn't see
the sign that said pedestrians only.
An old lady stopped me and guided me back
through the pedestrian area to the street.
</p>

<p>
I was confused about the direction in the
city and started going one way along the
street.
Then I changed my mind and decided to try the
other way.
Shortly I came to a place where I could see the
city accross a river valley.
That was where I wanted to get to.
The city was Minneapolis/St. Paul except
it had landmarks like the London Eye and
the Shard.
I started to go along the river road to
get back to the city.
</p>

<p>
My mechanism of holding the roller balls
completely broke down and I started to
look for alternatives to the cylindrical
metal bar that I had been using in
junk along the side of the road.
</p>

<p>
John Banks was there with a friend
and they were just walking and encouraged
me to do the same.
I eventually got something like the
roller ball mechanism working
with a large pole tapered to one
end like a torpedo and was able
to glide along the sidewalks of the river road
with John and his friend,
at least downhill or on the level.

with the clothes that were on the floor
but people came to get me before I could finish.

Before we went to the airport at the end of the day,
I had to go to work.
Work was like the west cluster at Thermo King

Gayatri and I were passengers.
The girl was talking about climate change.
I said if you were really concerned about it
you wouldn't even be driving this car.
She got so mad that she pointed the car
toward a cliff and then refused to
steer anymore.
I grabbed the wheel but it was to late to
stop the car from going over the cliff.
I was able to manuver the car while in
midair to land in a lake instead
of the ground so we all survived.
I swam over to the side of the lake
where they were selling drinks for the swimmers
and asked to call the police.
"For what?" the bartender asked.
"Justifiable homicide," I said.
We had a discussion around how
'justifiable homicide' was a legal term
and maybe we should just say
'attempted homicide'.
I called the operator on 0

The criminal showed up at the exhibition
to look at it and was taken away by the

We were all going to the movies.  
We were taking some of the grandparents
which included Jagi and Nomita.
But first we had to clean up a board game
that we had been playing.  
I insisted on putting it away all proper, 
so I sat on the floor and put the pieces
away in little bags.
But even so, the black and white stones
(like go pieces) were all mixed up.
This made me late and I couldn't find my phone.
I ran out to the car, where everyone was.
</p>

<p>
The living room where we were playing the 
game was large and square, with a 
big fireplace in the west wall, 
basically Georgian in style.  
There were large windown in the north wall
that looked up to a garden.
The table that we had been playing on was 
against the south wall.
The corridor led east and then turned south
to the main entrance where the car was waiting,
like the entrance to a hotel or apartment building.
</p>

<p>
It was a big white car, almost like a limo.
I noticed that 2 of the seats were empty,
mine and Gayatri's.  
I asked where Gayatri was, she had been 
taken to the dentist.
I wondered how they managed to drive her
all the way to the dentist and back in just that time.
I also wondered if it was she who had my phone.
We concluded that she must have.
I worried what would happen if I went off 
without my phone and she needed to reach me.
But I knew that if I went back in to the 
house, It would take just so long.
I wondered if I should have them take me to the
dentist to sit with her.
</p>

<p>
They started to drive the car away, even though I
was still holding the door open
and I had to tell them to stop.
Eventually we agreed that I would just 
come with them to the movie, for which
we were now very late.
Just how late I never figured out because 
what I thought was a clock giving the time wasn't.
I suggested that rather than being an hour late
for the 4:00 showing we should just go to the
6:00 showing, and they acted like that was their 
original plan all along.

The couch was facing west in a narrow living room

There were windows in the south wall of the

They were about communism.
One was supposed to teach you how

I paged through it while waiting. 
I noticed that it didn't really do
a very good job of teaching 
elementary German.
It had a not of colloquisms in it.
It also had Polish and Russian
language interspersed.
But the pictures and diagrams were
effective from a pedagological point of view.
</p>

<p>
There was a cart with bread on it to
the left of the coffee table.
</p>

<p>
I went over to get some bread.
I got flour all over my nice clothes.
We tried to brush them off.
Then we went out to the garden.

<h3 id="org85f70f1">Second chance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org85f70f1">
<p>
At some level I was aware that this
was a dream.
The premise was that I had an effectively
unlimited budget to set up the engineering 
department for a small electronics manufacturer.
So I was going around trying to order supplies
and equipment, and hire people.
</p>

<p>
There was a smaller room to the furthest south.
This then led, through a corridor on the west to 
a somewhat larger room just to the north.
North of that the corridor led to the reception 
area, where the entrance led out to the east.
Further north was the rest of the building. 
</p>

<p>
I decided that we would not put dev in one of the 
two rooms and test in the other, 
but would rather organize by product.
So our premire product, still under development,
would have dev and test teams in the smaller room.
While dev, production and test for our other products,
already in production, would be in the larger room.
</p>

<p>
I was leading someone I hired as the quality lead.
I was explaining to him that his role would be 
mostly on paper, deciding what good quality 
looked like, even if we had to 
cut corners for expediency.
I wondered to myself why I had to explain this
to him on his first day and if I would not have
already said this during the interview.
Someone else was in the south room, it may have
been X from JCI.
</p>

<p>
Then I went off looking for places to buy equipment
like lab equipment. 
I knew that I wanted a lot of equipment
but realized that I didn't really know what 
kind of equipment we needed or where 
to get it.
I started walking through the other rooms, 
asking the people there.
</p>

<p>
One of them explained that the cleaning lady
had retired and was moving into a
retirement home.
I couldn't really understand his accent
completely, but the upshot was that 
she wanted to retire in Israel but now 
was not the time.
I agreed that now was not the time.

<p>
I usually just ran the Tuesday AM meeting by the seat of my pants
because we had already covered stuff on Monday.
But today I wanted to review the data from the project tool
that we used.
I tried logging into my computer.
I was in a room in the corner of a building.
It was like a large classroom in Linwood,
but bigger than any of the rooms there.
The ceilings were much higher.
There were classroom tables arranged haphazardly.
There were old computers and other electronic equipment on the tables.
I went to the table in the far corner and tried to log it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgac55187">
<p>
Since there was time before the PM meeting, I decided to go to the
cafeteria to get a sandwich.
The cafeteria was a large space and the offerings and stations
were laid out in a large circular arc rather than in straight lines.
They advertised lots of vegetarian options, but
when you went up to them they were either already gone
or were only non food items.
I asked somebody and she pointed me to one of the areas 
but the selections seemed similar.

<p>
So I went with my sandwich to the other room where there were
already some people.
We had to rearrange the tables.
All the tables were like school chairs with the little desk area
for writing, except some of them were cut in half into trianges.
They were supposed to all fit together properly, but they didn't
fit together properly in practice.
I arranged my chair next to a colleague.
I then went over to sit on the ground next to a tree and 
eat my sandwich.
I had to hide the bottle of wine what was in my basket because
I was not supposed to be having that at work.
I started eating the sandwich and it had some meat on it which I 
picked out.
I then started eating the cucumbers that were in it but even they
had some kind of meat sauce smeared on them so I gave it up completely.

<h3 id="org447d34e">The Back Stairs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org447d34e">
<p>
There was a tiny little entrance to some stairs going up
where Gayatri used to play as a child.
I went up. 
They were very small and I was worried about
getting stuck in them or being able to get back down again.
When I got to the top of the stairs it was a landing with 
doors to two apartments. 
So these two apartments had a connection that they just kept 
closed.
I peered through the crack in the door to the right hand apartment.
There was a young family having cereal for breakfast.
The father noticed me and opened the door.
He stood right in front of my looking straight
into my eyes.
I tried to explain to him that my intentions were harmless.

<p>
Well Halloween isn't normally a national holiday, but 
it fell on a Saturday that year so everyone was treating it
like it was.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to comb my hair and it wouldn't behave.
I tried spraying water on it with a little spray bottle.
That didn't work.
I sprayed more and more water on it.  
I replaced the water in the bottle.
The bottle kept spraying when you held the 
nozzle down even when it was out of the bottle.
Finally I gave up and decided that I would have to take a full shower.
In Leo and Virginia's shower.
I had taken a shower there before.
When I turned the water on, the shower head sprayed 
outside the bath, but mostly on me so It didn't make a big mess.
When I finally got in the shower and washed my hair I discovered
why my hair had been so unruly.
I had candle wax from birthday candles in my hair, at
least the bottom parts of the hair.
I went down to the basement to get a tee shirt.
The basement was the basement of 1377.
At least there were clean pants and shirts there.
But I had painted on the inside of two of my 
Pikachu tee shirts that had sentimental value for me.
I thought to myself that I really must have been 
drunk the night before to do that and get wax in my hair 
as well.

We were in a class.  
We were supposed to be going through a 
case study/simulation.
Everyone had assigned seats.
I looked for a seat out on the far left.
But my assigned seat was closer to the front and center.
I sat down in the seat.
It was a large padded chair.
There were four of them right next to each other
for the four people in the team.  
The information for the scenario was on a table in front of us
and the chair backs were so high that I couldn't see or reach
over them in order to look at it.
So I contentent myself with sitting in the chair
and looking at the other materials that were there.
They had given us each a very nice backpack filled 
with a lot of merchandise.
But the merchandise was stuff live travel kits for 
toiletries and regular stationary.
Nothing that would help prepare for the scenario.

We were in a large hall where the meeting took place.
People from the client company kept going in and out.
They were always talking on the phone to their colleagues in other countries.
I thought to myself that they were really moving forward on a strategic level.
The project, which was ending, had led to a lot of strategic change and 
wasn't all just about the completion of the project tactically.
I had very little to do so I just sat cross-legged on the floor in front
of a low table and waited.
</p>

<p>
Then we were in a different room that had a large classroom table and 
a project screen along one wall.
I had given the meeting before but now someone from a new fancier company 
was coming in to do it.  
He didn't have a regular computer with him, but rather something like
a tv remote.
It could be connected to the projection equipment, but to do so 
we had to move all the wires closer to the screen and ourselves with 
the wires, so we all ended up scrunched close to the screen in a 
tangle of wires.

that they forgot something there

You had to be clean climbing up

I was in Pablo's studio which was a

near where Cheapo records used to be
on Snelling Avenue.
It was early in the morning and the sun
was just rising and I was thinking how
this was not the time to be doing
some kind of rock song.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking about using the equipment,
which was distributed haphazardly accross 
the bare floor, but hadn't actually started yet.
</p>

<p>
A lady who was also using the studio came in.
Pablo asked her what she thought of his song.

I heard another group chanting "Hate the dark magic!".
I thought to myself that they were wrong because
as soon as you have activated hate you are 
in the dark magic.
</p>

<p>
I continued walking along the sidewalk.
The area soon became flooded.
At first I just tried to tiptoe so as
not to get too wet, but then the water
got deeper and deeper.
Next I was standing on the metal fence
that ran along the sidewalk to stay out of the water.
I went to the end of the sidewalk, where there was a 
high cliff, leading to more little houses below.
The water was just rushing over the side down to 
the area below.
It carried me off to the left and spun me around so that
I was facing backwards.  
There were so many beautiful flowers and plants along
the path.  
I wondered if I was dying that this is what you saw then.

I just planned to do a lot of studying.
They had split our group up into three 
and had changed the names
and had really cool 
posters for them.

<p>
One of the girls and I started talking
about alternative schools.
She had been in one for one year and 
didn't like it.
When she found out that I had gone to

I had to get the car out of the 
garage parking lot so that we could 
catch the ferry.
</p>

But I didn't know where

had parked it.

Finally they came and took us to the
car.  It was through some narrow
curved stairs that I hadn't even
seen and didn't know about.
Then we were waiting for everyone to
get ready. 
They weren't going to be ready in time.
Which just meant that we would catch the 
next ferry &#x2013; ferrys came each half hour

We were going to a concert.

<p>
I had been at the election for 12 hours.
Going to the concert was similar in terms
of having to stay awake for that length of time.
</p>

<p>
We got into the bus, which was a boat.
The bus driver stopped, double parked,
at a stationary shop on Grand near Lexington.
</p>

<p>
He needed some invoice slips
because he was an independent contractor.
He didn't take long to run inside and by them.
</p>

<p>
We went along.
We were sitting in the upstairs of the bus.
It was a double decker.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting in front with one of 
Gayatri's colleagues, who was a younger man.
He was like Steve Larson.
</p>

<p>
I realized that I was 
making too many silly jokes.
I turned around to face the rest of the group.
</p>

<p>
At that time, he got up to do something,
but fell out the window.
I rushed over and looked down.
</p>

<p>
He was lying half out the window 
of the floor below.
I asked him if he was OK and he said no.
He thought that he had broken his leg.
</p>

<p>
It was a good thing that he had 
fallen into the window, because otherwise
he would have fallen into the river.
</p>

<p>
We had gone up a little channel
past the fork where the 
Minnesota meets the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
We were going somewhere in 
Minneapolis to pick up the last of
the colleagues of Gayatri
who were going with us
to the concert.
</p>

<p>
The bus driver stopped the boat immediately and
we all got out onto shore.
Four of us started to call 911 on our cell phones.
</p>

<p>
There were some other people milling about as it 
was an island that was a little park.
There was a pay phone there and 
some of the people were using it.
</p>

<p>
All four of us connected to 911
at the same time
so each of us thought that the other
would talk and we all hung up.
</p>

<p>
This made me very angry.
I called back and was still yelling
at everyone else when 
the emergency services operator 
came on the line.
</p>

<p>
So I had to apologize for yelling.
I explained that our friend had
been injured and that was why
we were upset.  
</p>

<p>
I explained our location to him
including the number on the pay phone.
</p>

<p>
He said that the river we were on was a 
dead end.
I said yeah, that we were only going to 
pick up our colleague.
</p>

<p>
The emergency services eventually 
came and took him away.
</p>

<p>
Then we were in a building, 
still waiting to go to the show.
</p>

<p>
I had taken a nap and was still sleepy.
Gayatri was making fun of me for it.
</p>

<p>
I was worried that we wouldn't have ear plugs
and that the show would be too loud and 
I wouldn't enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
Gayatri went to a waiting room for a pharmacy
clinic which happened to be in this building 
and got some ear plugs from them.

We were sitting by large glass windows

There were many long tables.
Like tables you would have in a schoolroom.
I had gum in my mouth.

She sat down and started to 
cry about the times she had been
left all alone.
</p>

<p>
I gave her a big hug to reassure her.
Then I gave her little brother a hug
as well so that he wouldn't 
feel neglected in the matter.

Gayatri and I were in the Pike Street House.
There was a whole lot more room 
in a couple extra rooms in the basement.
They were all empty.
But the rooms that were being used were filled 
with junk and dust.
</p>

<p>
We were sitting on the second floor of 
a house that was maybe like the Sheridan
house or maybe like Open School.
</p>

<p>
There was a small folk wedding going on.
Some of the ladies had put on these 
leather vests over their dresses and were
doing a little folk dance, quite lackidasically.
</p>

<p>
Gayatri and I were sitting on the floor 
with our backs against the wall watching the dance.
The TV was on in the background.
</p>

<p>
She was explaining the need to clean 
up the Pike St. house including throwing things away.
I pointed out that there was all that other space
and if we reorganized it there would be 
space for everything.
I was afraid that she would get mad at me 
for suggesting it of course.

We were at work.
It was a long wide hall 
that was like the temporary area 
at Thermo King but more corporate.
</p>

<p>
I was the leader.
I had an office at the end.
I was getting some coffee and some sweet snacks.
The syrup got on my cup and I tried to clean it off.
</p>

<p>
Some computers were set up on a picnic table in a
tent outside in the parking lot, which was 
a lot like the TK parking lot.
</p>

<p>
One of my reports, who was a cross between
Dan Smith and Trenton, 
was debugging the download.
</p>

<p>
I was also trying to set up a computer
in the lab, which was also the break room,
to debug the download.
</p>

<p>
I checked with him and one other lady 
who was working with him.
I just wanted to make sure that they 
had a plan for what experiments they were going to do.
I didn't want to push them to a specific 
promise because I knew that there were uncertainties.

There were 6 snakes/lizards and 6 ducks born all at the same time.
3 times we met them.  Each time, 2 of the lizards and 2 of the ducks were there.  The lizards each ate one duck.  The ducks never struggled or put up any resistance.
</p>

<p>
Finally on the third time after one of the lizards had eaten one of the ducks I couldn't take it anymore.  We were standing on the corner of Hamline and Pascal in St. Paul.  I grabbed the last duck and decided to take it home with me.  I knew I couldn't keep it forever and I wasn't sure what I was going to do in the sequel.  I thought that babaka would think it was just like when I had ducky-duck.

I went farther east (except it was west) on my bicycle than ever before.  I went down the river and along the shore, till the shore turned into bedclothes and a narrow path. I got to the end of the path and jumped accross a fence.  The fence was very low.  It was the fence to a childrens backyard in an urban residential neighborhood.  It was all bright pastel colors like animation.
</p>

<p>
We went to a church event.  I didn't really want to be there.  They had their relics at the door, which were links of sausages.  I picked some up becuase I was supposed to use them.  There was a square hole high up in the wall with some asymetric lettering around it.  I wondered what it meant.
</p>

<p>
I got tired of holding the relics and set them down on the ground.  Someone from the church came and picked them up and took them back to the entrance where I had found them.
</p>

<p>
Finally we were able to go in.  Everybody started running.  Gayatri ran ahead of me.  I thought I saw her sitting in one of the rows but it was someone else.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting with Clayton and someone else.  Brad Ludwig was in the other room.  We heard him speaking loudly.  I couldn't make out what he was saying because others were speaking at the same time.  I asked Clayton and Q. to tell me what he said.  He came out and started talking to us.  The upshot is that we all had to be 'broader', which was the consequence of them trying to do the same amount of work with fewer people.

I wanted to get some coffee.
I went looking for it.
I went down a hallway that was in a U shape.
It was like here the auditorium in Linwood was,
was the outside hallway of the fine arts building
at Macalester.
I walked through and they had lots of art from
their current students class.
They were all pictures of gladiators fighting.
They were all certainly better than me 
at figurative work.
One of them had put a picture of someone
doing thier makeup in the mirror and
the gladiators were fighting only in the reflection.

There were metal gates in some areas.

the car key fob activated an MG midget
at the end of the parking lot which was
close to the building and far from the entrance.
There was snow everywhere.
There was ice over the car and I broke through
enough to get in.
Someone came and told me that I had to take

It was like a family of Porto Ricans or something.
I backed up and tried to get the car

I sent my mom over to the other side of the

She never came back.
I continued trying to pack the snow

There were benches with chairs.
The computers on the benches in front of the chairs

I did some refactoring of some templates.
But when I changed the window size 
all the tabs became misalinged 
so I had to rebuild.
I sat there the whole morning wondering
if someone was going to be upset

But when the afternoon came around everyone
was into team building activities and
nobody asked me any questions about the progress

So I went off to lunch.
But first I packed away my little 
weed pipe.
It finally fit into a smaller case
and I was pleasantly surprised.
I got some change in case I had to pay 
something in the cafeteria.
I actually had 2 $5 bills, which
was more than enough.
Also, when I am looking for change
usually I find these oversize coins
that are memorabilia only.
This time I was able to get them
all together and pack them away in storage.
</p>

<p>
I went to the cafeteria.
They had some fruit.  
I guessed I would just get that.
There was a baggy that in addition
to some nice nuts and raisins also had
grapes and a half a zucchini, but
it was what was on offer so I 
picked it up anyway.
</p>

<p>
Rahim Allana told me that the
pizza was free today so I figured 
that I would get that.
I went ahead of the people at the counter
because I didn't want anything from there.
Brad Ludwig was talking to someone else

some silverware.
I told him about the superstition of
handing people knives.

I was chained in the water to a rock.
I tried everything to break the chain.
In the center, at the ends of the chain.
But it wouldn't break.
Finally I dived under the water and pulled on the chain.
Slowly the rock that the chain was tied to
slid out of the wall that it was in.
I then had to swim away with the 
weight of both the rock and the chain.
It was all I could do to keep afloat 
but I managed it.
The person who had chained me was very cavalier
about my ability to escape.

I was in a class.
The teacher was giving us a 
business use case.
She wrote a bunch of instructions on the blackboard.
We were supposed to start putting our impression of it.
The instructions led me to believe that we should
give great attention to the format, layout and appearance
of the document physically on the paper.  
I spent a long time thinking about it.
It was hard for me to read the blackboard.
Then I started putting a basic use case with a sequence diagram
onto three sheets of 8 1/2 x 11 paper, landscape.
</p>

<p>
I didn't get very far by the time the exercise was over.
The teacher asked me to show my work.
But I had put the last two pages at the bottom of a pile
of blank sheets.
I was using scratch paper and so some of the sheets
already had printing on one side
and I was only using the other blank side.

I couldn't find the other two pages even though
they were the ones that could show that I was thinking
about content rather than just introduction.

We let a drawer down on a string

When it came back up, it had lots of

I thought we had made a significant 
archealogical discovery.  
I ran to get the archeologist lady
who was giving tours in a different 
part of the building.
</p>

<p>
She said that these were all the 
work of one master's studio.
And that they had a lot of other examples

When I got to the front of the line
I couldn't find the papers.
I looked for them but by that time
the boat was leaving the dock.
I had literally and metaphorically

I thought that I could identify it

<p>
I started walking down 7th street to 
downtown St. Paul.
John Banks started walking with me.
We talked about taking the bus 
or just walking.
We decided to walk.
We got about 2/3 of the way there
and John was tired so we stopped to rest
in an alley.
I read some magazines that he had
until he was ready to continue.
We got to his work and he sat down
at his desk.
I tried to find a place where 
I could sit and there wasn't anybody.
But everybody else from his work 
was starting to come in
so I left on my own.
Even though there was security 
getting in
no one stopped me on my way out

On weekdays there was an abandoned
factory that I could sneak into

to a shelter.
I went upstairs.
It was all wooden and they 
kept fish there.
I didn't like touching the fish
but the blanket was just big enough.
In the morning they just had a small amount
of bread and water for breakfast.
The others got more but I figured since I
hadn't paid I couldn't complain.

Prior to his surrender, he had been

The butterfly was a robot with

reporting the activities back to 
the remaining rebels.

I left the movie theatre
that my friends and I 
had gone to.
The movie theatre
was on the top floor
of the complex.
The complex was 
a little old and industrial.
Not a modern shopping center.
It was an article of faith
that to get back into the movie theatre
I had to have chewing gum.
So I started to go down to the 
ground floor to buy some chewing gum.
</p>

<p>
I got lost a little on some of the top
floors, as they had mazes of
hallways, ramps and stairs
going up and down in 
confusing order.
</p>

<p>
There were maintenance people
pushing long carts at
dangerous speed and nearly 
hitting myself and some of the
others there.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I got down to the
bottom floor where the 
concessions were.
</p>

<p>
I tried to get some gum 
out of the vending machine.
I struggled to find change.
At first I thought there was 
no gum in the machine.
Then I thought I found it
but when I got it 
it turned out to be 
something like jelly beans.
</p>

As I left I wondered 
why I needed chewing gum
to get back in the theatre
rather than my ticket?

<p>
I was in Britan.
I was living a lone in 
an apartment on the main street.
Across the street was a 
convenience store.
I went over to get something
mostly because I was bored.
The shelves were unusually low;
waist height.
Not able to store as much
as the head height ones
in a regular store.
It was as if they didn't
care how much they were able to sell.
There wasn't a lot there 
that was particularly interesting.
For example, there was no pop.
</p>

<p>
There was even a large section
of a shelf dedicated to books.
But they were the kind of books
that you used for staging
like old readers digest
rather than stuff you 
would actually read.
</p>

<p>
I looked at one of them 
and it was like an 
old cookbook and
helpful hints for housewives.
But it wasn't really,
I was only the top half
of the pages from that 
book and it was made to
look aged which made 
even that half almost
unreadable.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that they had 
a bar and I could have
ordered pop from the bar
but the owner was behind 
the counter helping other
customers so I didn't want 
to interrupt him.
</p>

<p>
I thought about buying 
tobacco but resisted.
They loose tobacco was
on the shelves but the
cigarettes were 
behind the counter.
</p>

<p>
Finally I picked up 
a bag of potato chips 
for want of anything else.
</p>

<p>
When I got to the counter 
I saw that they had
toaster pastries behind the
counter so I asked for that.
It wasn't the regular 
brand name and I couldn't
quite read it so I asked about it. 
</p>

<p>
It was 'French' something.
The owner added up the price
in his head and told me GBP 1.45.
I was going to give him a 
5 pound note at first 
but managed to find exact change:
two 50p two 20p one 5p.

trailing behind a plane
coming in to land.
</p>

<p>
At first I thought it was just
the way the clouds were trailing behind.
But then I realized that it was 
three planes that had crashed together
and were falling.
One of the planes was smaller 
than the other two and was a DC-10.
It very clearly said DC-10 on the side.
</p>

<p>
I turned away as the planes fell and tried to 
get out of the area.
I followed a number of people who were
also leaving along the fence,
and into the tram.
</p>

<p>
I tried to go up a hill.
It was a very steep hill and 
there was a rope to hold on to as you went up.
A voice was saying something about
Monaco or some other country.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga5881b9">
<p>
We were fighting giant letters.
Symbols carved out of stone.
The battle would be 1-1;
there would be one person removed
on each side.
First the Americans went.
When they were done, the UK went.
The UK were almost finished when the 
Germans started.
I went under the water
and found a sheet of plastic.
I lifted up the sheet of plastic that
was stopping the water from receding.
The water started receding
and the Germans realized that they 
didn't have to fight after all.

<h3 id="org531b316">Future Nazis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org531b316">
<p>
This was all happening in a far future
where the goals of Nazis and other 
anti-semites were being realized
to create a genetically engineered culture.
Ostensibly for the improvement of mankind
but horrible to live in.
</p>

<p>
We were on a ship.
There were many of us captured and 
sitting like prisoners on a troop transport.
The nazi captain came in and started to 
show us the effects of their genetic engineering work.
One of the prisoners, a Scotsman, had been 
put through their machines.
There was now skin hanging off his 
face like a veil, 
He was many pounds heavier and twice 
his width.  
And he had fur and hooves like a goat now.
He was clearly not happy but the 
captain made out like this was great.
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant came through and started
to explain how we were all going to be organized
into different fighting units.  
There were like six ranks above us
and were were being organized into the 
bottom three ranks.
But he made it sound like being selected
into the first of those bottom three ranks
would be a priviledge.
To be a robust goat man like the Scotsman
had been made into.
He had a name for it and tried to write it
on the whiteboard but it was too long
so he just put an abbreviation.
</p>

<p>
I whispered to the person next to me 
"fight and attack?". 
There was no answer.
Then one of the guards came over
so I didn't say anything more.
I thought that if they asked me what 
I was saying I would tell them that
I said "warm in the back".
</p>

<p>
Then Dan Smith and I escaped 
through a side door.
We went running down many 
corridors and rooms.
They were all decorated in
black and white only.
Everything was black and white
only and I commented on this.
</p>

<p>
Eventually we came to a room.
On the left was a door and on
the right was a window.
We went through the window into
a greenhouse type area that 
was open to the outside.
The outside was all desert here.
And there were guards.
They were genetically modified to 
be like collections of rocks that 
could fly.
Like if the rock guy from the 
fantastic four was compressed 
into a flying saucer shape and
some of the rocks at the edges 
were only held together loosely.
</p>

<p>
I flew through the window.
I was able to avoid the flying 
rock guards because I was able to 
fly higher.
</p>

<p>
The desert gave way to grass.
There was a caravan of a 
noblewoman (in the future nazi regime).
I flew down and grabbed her dress.
I flew away from them and started 
to put the dress on for a disguise.
It was easy to get the first part on 
but hard to get the left arm on.
My left fingers got caught in a 
piece of string and the wrist 
and I spent a long time getting them loose.
</p>

<p>
Finally I flew away in the dress.
The grass started to give way to woodlands.  
I flew down to the ground.
I decided that I shouldn't be in the 
most rugged, dirty parts because it 
wasn't likely that a noblewoman would be there.
So I stuck to the flat grassy areas 
but stayed by the trees for some 
sense of being hidden.
</p>

<p>
I then came to a more residentail area
and was going up and down sidewalks 
and small trails past houses.
</p>

<p>
Someone else was in the same area and it was
the noblewoman whose dress I had stolen.
She would be able to recognize me so I had 
to avoid her.

My cat came with me.
Because the cat always

I would go into work

But this time I didn't
go into work so 
she was confused.
We sat there on the lawn
next to each other for
a while.
</p>

<p>
Then we turned around to 
go back home.
My cat always went back
along a little wire fence.
So we did it that way again.
She was confused because 
the timing was different.
She got halfway and then
I climed on the fence
to help her and
together we got 
most of the rest of

One of the band members was in full costume.
They were helping out the science
teacher; helping to teach the class.
They were interspersing just enough
science lesson in what they were saying
to avoid the science teacher stopping them.
But mostly what they were talking about
was their heavy metal version of the Kabalah.
He had a tee shirt that showed thier
version of the Kabalah tree of life.
It was basicallly upside down.
They had God-above-man as Malkuth
on top and God-within-man as Yesod below that.

I climbed up on top.
There was a spray can there.

Some people were fishing and there
were fishing lines running accross

I came in and saw some spagetti
in a pot so I thought that they
had already eaten and I started to
get this for myself.
I pored the leftover noodles
onto my plate.
The water that they were boiling in
had taken so much starch that 
it started to congeal.

There was flooding.
And this meant that everyone
was walking around on the

with water up to their necks.

I asked if some of them wouldn't
just use the first level.

<p>
I was sitting on a bridge looking 
out at a lot of fast moving traffic.
I was thinking about how AI was
accellerating everything.
Imagine what you think life would
be like in the year 3000.  
Then imagine that AI will allow us
to accellerate to bring that about
by 2200.
</p>

<p>
I then had an idea for a story,
which I explained to Gayatri
as she was driving me around
through parks.
</p>

<p>
In the future,
everyone had to keep moving all the time.
It was a crime to stop moving or sleep.
Everyone had to stay distracted at all times
so that they could never pose a threat
to the elite.
Only the elite were allowed to sleep but
nobody else even knew that.
They were able to go without sleep because
medical science had advanced so much that
they had drugs that allowed it.
</p>

<p>
Then one day, our hero who was working
on the machines that they used to keep 
people moving. 
Conveyor belts and drones and the like.
Discovered a way that he could 
appear to keep moving but actually 
be sleeping.
He told his girlfriend about this.
Together they started to sleep at nights.
Together they started to understand
how the elite were controlling 
their society.
Together they started to craft a plan
to stop it.

This was the second class,
the following week.
The previous week's class
hand ended with a fun quiz
including questions like 
what hell was like.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to start this time
by repeating that.
</p>

<p>
There were 7 categories of
questions, with a handful
of questions under each category.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to start this class
with a repeat of that quiz.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to choose the questions 
to ask randomly.
</p>

<p>
There was of course no time to
prepare a tool to create the
random selection so I just
hoped that I would be able to 
wing it.
I also had very little idea 
what to do for the rest of the class.
</p>

<p>
I thought I had some dice.
I looked through my backpack
and overturned the pockets 
onto the table but
all I could find was a 
few mismatched six sided dice.
</p>

<p>
We started to write the questions
out on the whiteboard.
Or at least the high level 
categories because there
wasn't really time to write them
all out.
</p>

<p>
But the whiteboard markers didn't
show up very well and I had
to go searching for better ones.
I didn't find any.
Gautham found that they would show
up if you wrote on the varnished
wooden pegboard that was 
behind the whiteboard.
I was concerned that it wouldn't
be able to be erased from there.
He was like, what to do?
</p>

<p>
I finally gave up on trying to 
randomize the questions and just
picked one to ask of someone in the class.
I had also wanted to randomize who to ask
but that couldn't happen either.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that there was another class
being given in the same classroom
behind some glass dividers that had
been set up.
It was hard to tell who was in 
our class and who was in the other one.

about giving information.

<p>
Becuase I should get information
from my own company first.
Asking Watlow for information
on what they were doing was
a poor substitute for 
not myself knowing what
my own company was doing.
</p>

<p>
I was driving around 
the countryside 
toward Winona.
Or maybe it was near Rosedale.
I was recollecting how
I had thought about getting
a job in Watlow.
But my wife would never agree.
The cost of living there was
nice, if you had income like
for the Twin Cities.
But of course your income
would be correspondingly smaller.

I was on my way to a party.
I was taking the bus there.
My phone got stuck 
in some music/video mode.
A kid in the seat in front
of me told me to turn it off.
I said that I didn't know how.
He said to swipe right
and then use the 'power up' 
(swipe up) move.
It worked!  
The phone entered a mode where
I could adjust what the 
cursor keys and other 
special keys did.
The cursor keys were
minor indentations
in the plastic of the screen.
So that they didn't 
interfere with looking 
at it.
But you could feel the
indentation if you
wanted to use the keys.
</p>

<p>
A Japanese man got on the 
bus and handed me a sheet
of papers in a folder.
The folder opened at the 
narrow end of the papers
instead of the wide end.
That was my phone now.
I looked at the papers
but they were mostly in Japanese.
So I put the folder in 
my backpack 
in the hope that 
it would turn back
into my phone.
It did.
</p>

<p>
I got off the bus.
I went up the elevator
of the building.
Then I realised that 
I had gotten off the bus
one stop too early.
On the East side of 
the Washington 
avenue bridge 
instead of the
West side.
</p>

<p>
So I went back 
and started walking 
to the correct building.
Sarah Emerson got
off the bus behind me
and started talking to me.
At first I thought that 
she was mocking me.
She was going to the 
same party.
She was like, 'Oh, who
are you going to 
be there with, like
Dan Smith and 
Sean Kelly?'
</p>

<p>
I let her catch up
to me and we held hands.

They had a plastic bottle

bottle of grapefruit juice
sticking up out of a bench
in order to show their options.

I said that I wanted the 
grapefruit juice and she 
picked it up for me.

She came with a small bowl
overfilled with some
dark pocket breads.
I went to get another for myself.
She said that we should 
just share that one.
I went to look for 
what else they had.
But all they had was 
just different kinds of bread,
most of which were 
too large.

In the same corner,
made of shelving,
in the middle of the cafeteria,
there were offerings of
dinner settings.

This was the kind of school that
you were only supposed to

going to take me a lot longer.

I was in the back left of the classroom.
I was tilted 90 degrees to the
rest of the students as if
I was lying in bed and they
were all sitting in chairs.

<p>
I was a senior student
but I was nowhere near where the
teachers were
and I wondered how I would
ever get there.
</p>

<p>
The professor was giving a 
talk on some cryptography thing.
He stated that the password
in the system was (whatever it was)
and wrote it down on the chalkboard
with each character filling 
a place shown by underscores:
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">X</span>  <span class="underline">Y</span>  <span class="underline">Z</span>  <span class="underline">W</span>  <span class="underline">_</span> <span class="underline">_</span> <span class="underline">_</span> <span class="underline">_</span> 
</p>

<p>
Then he opened up the system and
checked the password.
</p>

<p>
I had been working on the system
and had changed the password,
not realizing that anyone else
was going to be using it.
</p>

<p>
When he checked the password in 
the system he found that it
had been changed to 'LOVERS'.
He wrote it on the board.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">L</span>  <span class="underline">O</span>  <span class="underline">V</span>  <span class="underline">E</span>  <span class="underline">R</span> <span class="underline">S</span>

of the class that indeed that
was the new password.
I felt very embarassed both
for being the only one 
to speak in class and for 
having changed it on my own.

San Francisco.

<p>
I had been working with
¿Shell as a contractor.
On Friday I had been involved in
some meetings that discussed
the company meeting with
a third party supplier 
in San Fransisco the 
following Wednesday.
I had said that I would
be available because 
I was pretty sure that
the company I was working 
with was not going to
go trough with it
or in any case was not
going to keep me on
the project.
</p>

<p>
I figured that I could 
give a response for the
time of the meeting on
Monday, since there was a
good chance it would be 
cancelled by then.
But sure enough, here was
the person who was 
coordinating the meeting
calling to say that they 
needed at specific time.
So I told them 11:30
thinking that if it 
did go through, it would 
give me the maximum
time to get from the airport
while still being a convenient
morning time for them.
</p>

<p>
She was there in the 
same room with her boss.
They discussed it and
confirmed that 11:30 
would be acceptable.
</p>

<p>
I thought that would be
the end of the phone call.
The connection kept
going in and out.
They kept talking in 
the background.
It was pretty clear that
they were talking about something
that didn't apply to me.
But they didn't say goodbye.
</p>

<p>
A great wind started to
blow the back door open.
I had to try to close
the door with one hand
while holding on to the phone
with the other hand.
</p>

<p>
The third, heavy wooden door 
was half off its hinges.

each device would have to 
talk to every other device.
I was thinking that 
they could each be

<p>
I stared to speak critically,
but then stopped myself and
started over with how 
important the issue that they
were bringing up was
and how there might be other 
ways to address it.

I still didn't think
I would end up going to

I did undo, revert, cut and
paste from a previous version.
But if I missed even a single one,
They would grow and come back again.

This is how they came into our world.
Through the intersities between

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga9b4366">
<p>
I was sitting in a room.
The room was like
the living room of
Garnet + Sophie's 
in Lake Crystal.
I was sitting at a 
small table surrounded 
by papers.
I was working at a computer.
I was trying to get
the application running
so that I could debug it.
</p>

<p>
Then I went to the room 
next door, which was where
the kitchen at Garnet and Sophie's
in Lake crystal would have been.
This was larger, like a
common room at a school.
There was large table there
that sat several people.
I sat there.
</p>

<p>
There was a young man 
who was looking into 
some management training
that the company was encouraging.
The company was a little
ma + pa shop like Access Specialties.
I knew I couldn't stay there very long.
I recommended that he think about
what he was trying to accomplish
with his training.
If it was just regular project management,
the brochure that he was looking at
even referenced them.
We finally settled on 'Logistics Management'.
I asked if he knew linear algebra.
He said no.
I told him that he would have to learn it
if he was going into logistics management!
</p>

<p>
There was a lady there,
an older French lady.
She came and stood to the left side 
of the table.
She really liked lavender and put a 
little jar with some lavender on the table.
I &#x2013; somewhat jokingly &#x2013; covered it up
with a piece of paper.
Well really it was too much for me.
Then to recover, I made out like I
just wanted to use the piece of 
paper to get the smell of lavender.
</p>

<p>
An eastern european gentleman 
was sitting at the far left corner of 
the table, working on his computer.
He was further along in understanding
the companies programs than I was.
He asked me if I could help him 
debug a problem.
I said sure as this was a good 
way for me to learn.
He explained that there were
two objects in his code that
were supposed to react to an event.
He knew that one of the objects 
was not going to react because of
a different problem that he 
already knew about.
But he didn't understand why the
other object didn't react.

I felt very high for

I had a coffee machine under my arm.
It was a square box with a couple
of buttons and knobs in it.
It was bulky and just a little bit
larger than convenient to carry.
</p>

<p>
I was going to go to lunch.
I decided not to go to the
vending machine on the floor that
I usually go to.
I went down one floor to where there 
was a full cafeteria.
The coffee machine started to 
make noises.
Loud enough to bother the
people around me.
I twisted one of the dials
to release the pressure
and it stopped making noises
for a little while.
</p>

<p>
I went past the seats
where chinese food was served
to the vending machines
at the far end.
</p>

<p>
I stopped to pour the coffee
into a sink.
When I poured the coffee into
the sink, I was also
urinating into the sink.
A lot of urine came out
and it was bright yellow
almost green.
I thought to myself that
I shouldn't have drunk
so much mountain dew
the night before.

Some people came by and
I rushed to button up

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0282a7a">
<p>
We were getting a new rental car.
We were in a large room, like
an art supplies area.
There were tables in the middle
and shelving around the sides.
</p>

<p>
Mike dumped the keys out on the table.
Specific keys, which were tagged
with plastic tags in different colors
were critical, and the rest 
were just there.
I undid the keyholder and then
started putting the keys back
onto the keyholder, taking
care not to lose the 
critical ones.
</p>

<p>
I went over to a different table.
There were pictures and 
business cards on it.
I started to collect some of the
ones that we might need.
We needed some of them for the rental
car but not necessarily all of them.
Jimmy was standing by the table
and we discussed some of the 
pictures of his family that
were there.
</p>

<p>
Beside another table were some
of the paintings that I had done.
We had to decide which of them to 
keep and which not to.
Most of them were too large
and didn't need to be kept
so I set them aside.
</p>

<p>
I then went over to the shelving.
One of the people who was helping
me was going through some 
art supplies that were on the 
shelving and deciding which
of them to take for the new
rental car.
I told him I would do that
and he could go over to some 
other part.

<h3 id="orgde0cdf5">Traffic Accident on the highway</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgde0cdf5">
<p>
We were in an apartment.
It was like it was on the
north west side of 
Snelling and University
but it was a little 
more upscale.
I had to go get a rental car.
</p>

<p>
I was driving back along the
highway with the rental car.
There was a loud <i>ding!</i> alarm
and the car indicated that there
was less than 10% gas.
It also told me &#x2013; because it
was a smart dashboard &#x2013; that the
nearest gas station was at
the second exit.
I decided I would take 
exit and fill up.
It wouldn't do to run
out of gas on the 
way back to them.
The lanes started to merge.
The rightmost lanes of the highway 
were closed off for construction
and the highway was down to one lane.
I had to suddenly merge over.
I was merging blind because I
had failed to adjust my left
mirror properly. 
I could only see in the 
rear view mirror.
I made it to the leftmost lane
but then through no fault
of my own someone hit
me from behind
and then I bumped the person in front
of me.
There was a large number of 
cars pulled over on the 
left side of the highway
all in the accident.
I pulled over as well
even though I could have
driven on because it was
the right thing to do.
</p>

<p>
I dreaded the thought that
I didn't have my insurance
with me because we were
travelling and I had left it
at home.
If anyone asked I would just
have to tell them that
I would get it for them later.
</p>

<p>
I did a quick check of the
car and could see that
there was no visible damage
so I at least wouldn't be
in trouble with the 
rental car company.
</p>

<p>
I tried to use my phone
but it was stuck in ads.
I got mad at it.
It started to bend and warp.
A kid came along and
threw it in the river
that was running just 
next to the highway.
</p>

<p>
I realized that I was
in a foreign town
without identification
or a cell phone
and I was naked
down to my underwear.
</p>

<p>
There was only one 
thing to do in a situation
like this.
I stretched my arms before me
pointed them at the sky across
the river and 
started flying.

I flew down into a tunnel.

down and down.
It was square and 
painted green.
It could have been in 
a high school if it
had been in a different place.
</p>

<p>
I got to the bottom 
where there was a little 
landing and the tunnel
got too narrow to 
get through.
Someone was sitting there.
</p>

<p>
I turned and stared going back up.
They were now full hallways
like school hallways.
</p>

<p>
In a room off of the hallway
some people were fighting.
Except it wasn't a fight like
a fight; it was like a cartoon
fight or in batman.
</p>

<p>
I looked back along the corridor
to check that my mother wasn't
watching because I 
didn't think she would
understand the fight.

In the last office before
the elevator,
we were in the back seat 
of a car.
We had to squeeze together
four of us in the back
and two or three in the front.
Gayatri was next to me
and the rest were all women.
</p>

<p>
On the shelf in the office
were sweets.  
And not just little 
mints and hard candies
like you have in offices.
I wouldn't have felt bad 
taking one of those.
But rather large pudding
and mousse.
Like something you would buy
for a special party you 
were going to have at the 
office after work.
</p>

<p>
I turned away from them 
because I saw that they
weren't just for 
causal visitors.
But Gayatri picked up
a spoon and started 
eating the largest one.
</p>

<p>
She pretty much finished it
and left me only to 
lick the bowl.
</p>

<p>
I called one of the people
in the front seat 'Alex'.
Her name was Alexandria
and she didn't like 
being called Alex.
I paused, and then thought
to call the other person
in the front seat.
But I accedentally called
them Alex again.  
Faux Paux.

it was more like rent

I said that they had
been in the house so

assumed that it was
already paid off.
So don't get mad at 
me for asking; it
is a reasonable question

who do that even if 
you haven't.

The attendant who

moving very slowly.
And when we heard her
talking to her colleagues
she was complaining 
about how much work

Apparently they were
hiring more attendants
in order to be able to
do all the work.
Because every single
one of them moved about 
30% slower than in

So rather than just 
hire people who moved at

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ef1eb8">
<p>
The office led to a bridge
accross an open courtyard
like a shopping mall.
It was winter.
One thing I didn't have
after packing all those
things from my office into
the backpacks was headphones.
So I had to just go over
a song in my head.
I had to be careful not to
click my shoes on the ground
in time with the song in my head
or people would think it strange.
</p>

<p>
The bridge led to an elevator.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org572382c">
<p>
Down the elevator and then 
into a train.
The train went down a hill
and then along a river.
There was a story of 
how there had been some
kind of labor action
involved on the 
train line.
It was famous in 
that neighborhood anyway.

<p>
We sat on the 
square wooden bridge 
platform where the 
train and the road met
up with the river that
came in at an angle.
Someone who was sitting
there with a group of us,
cross legged on the bridge,
told about a story he 
attributed to the Hindus.
When you pass from the heaven
of fire to the heaven of earth,
the God [mumble] gets notified.
And when you pass from the heaven of
earth to the heaven of air, the 
god [mumble] gets notified.
But when you pass from the 
heaven of swimming (water) to
the next heaven, the god [mumble]
doesn't get notified.
Which is why hindu families 
pray every day to that god 
letting them know that they are
passing from the heaven of swimming
ahead of time.

<p>
I went under the bridge.
The ice was staring to melt
so it was very wet.
A lady came up to me and
showed me the design on
the arches that held up the bridge.
It was exactly the design
on the bracelet that I had.
She asked where I got the bracelet.
I said that I thought one of 
my aunties had given it to me.
Then I paused.  
Either that or you gave it
to me?
She looked at me and said
"Tweleve years ago we thought
you were a quick thinker.
Now we are not so sure."

Gayatri knew where it was and
went into a corner room

She said that Ed had lied

call him on a pretext.
I said that no, it was just
that he couldn't be bothered,

The guy was giving lessons.
I make a copy of his work.
He had already called it ..xxx..pma

The ink in the pen went from

He started to mix some drinks.
They showed the ice going into

At first it was all pretty

got lopsided and ugly.
They showed some underwater
scenes similarly.
There was an octopus stuck to
my hand.
I said OK time to go and
I put it over the side of
the bed and it ran off.
Everyone ran off down the street.
The street was dry and dusty.
It was the dryness that was

It started to rain.
The ground was so dry

We were working on a project.
One of the people who was

I tried to check my schedule on
my phone but I had removed the
cover and it was all open wires.
Three pieces, two large side by side
and one small at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
There was an app that I couldn't close
and that I had to reboot for.
It used to get installed becuase 
I had installed a game but
now it was getting installed 
just because of Teams.
</p>

<p>
So I decided to go to the 
phone repair store and get them
to reattach the cover and screws
the way it was originally since 
I for sure had lost them.
</p>

<p>
First they said that they 
didn't have them.
Then I asked if they could
just order them and they 
reluctantly agreed.
It was 30 bucks.
But the only way I could
pay for it was with my phone
so I had to mess around to
get that working and it

The teachers assistant came in

but she didn't have enough.
She went back to get more.
Half of us started the test.
The rest of us waited and
fell asleep while waiting.
I went out to the hallway
to get more tests from the 
teacher, explaining that
the assistant had handed them 
out incorrectly.
For example, there were two
remaining copies of the guide
for the test but only one actual
test remaining, so one of the
people didn't get the guide.
I thought that I was going to
have to get more coffee after
sleeping but all of the coffee

I lived in an apartment there..
I had to run up to get my keys.
I left my car in a little
concrete plaza in front of the 
apartment building with 
the door open.
I ran up to my apartment.
There was a fat lady there
lying on the floor.
I left.
I realized that I had 
forgotten my keys.
I went back and asked
her for the keys.
She had placed them on her
key chain, which had a lot
of safely pins.
I tried to get my key ring
off of hers but at first
I didn't, I just released
some of her small safety pins.
Then I realized that the main
key chain that was holding everything
was an oversized safety pin.
I undid that and grabbed my keys.
I left her to redo her key chain
because I was in a hurry.
She didn't seem to mind.

<p>
I went back down to my car
and a pig faced lady with
glasses smoking a cigarette
was sitting in my car.
I tried to get her out of there.
The other people sitting in 
traffic told me to stop.
I tried to expalin that it

Someone asked me to get

The side of the table where they were.
I pointed to it.
I wondered why they couldn't 
just get it themselves.  
But I has to get it.
I was tired and it was
very inconvenient for me.
I crawled under the table
to go get it.
When I did I saw
an old book that happened
to be there.
It talked about 'the line'
which I thought meant the
spine of mountains through
North and South America.
But there was a picture
of a cabin in the woods during
the four seasons.
Where the cabin had been 
repeated four times 
so that the right end
of one side of the image
of the cabin was the left 
side of the next image.
And each image was the same
cabin but the yard in front
showed the changes through
the different seasons.

I was having a hard time 
organizing my notes in Math Class.
I had a bunch of home work 
from other people
but I hadn't handed in any of my own.
I didn't have any full blank pages 
to take notes on 
and when I tried to write on
a half sheet it would 
split in half again
until I had just thin 
strips of paper that were
useless for taking notes on.
</p>

<p>
The teacher came over and gave
me some of other peoples homework
because they saw the names of the
people whose homework I had
for some reason.
I had to explain that it wasn't
me and tried to give 
it back to them.

They were teaching us about
</p>

<p>
A -&gt; A(x)A -&gt; A
(a, b) -&gt; a - b

But they were doing it the 
other way around to the way 
that I was used to.
Instead of telling us what
and then having us figure
out how for ourselves, 
they were showing us how
by writing out all elements
of A(x)A on the blackboard
and having us write down
how they combine together.

This made it harder for me
to understand so I had to
think about it mote.

I said that if they weren't

stopped to explain that this
is what the free birds did.
They went to the field in the 
morning, ate as much as they
wanted, and then just did
whatever they wanted for the
rest of the day.
They had some notes on the
ground in different locations
asking questions about the 
new bird.  
They would be asking them
when they got back from

I was listening to an old
bird, he was saying 
important things that I wanted 
to hear.

I had looked at the questions
on the ground and had started
some thoughts on the subject.
It seemed like it all came
down to how you felt.
See, if you felt ok, you 
could fly.
I couldn't fly straight up
but I was at least able to 
float around the tables.
They asked if I could fly

He complimented several people
for their work, not me.
The lady who I helped pick

Then the meeting was over and

I decided to do what 
I always do, which was
go to the library on one of 
the top floors.

<p>
I started walking through
stairways and hallways 
to the library.
But I saw that they had a picture of
me &#x2013; I was wanted for having been 
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
They didn't know who I was, 
they just had my picture from 
a survellience camera.
But somebody might recognize me
if I went there, so I quickly
turned and went a 
different direction
down some stairs.
</p>

<p>
We got captured and had to
escape from some bullies.
I explained to the person that
I escaped with that I was wanted 
for squatting.
So he felt that it was too risky
to be with me and
went his own way.
</p>

<p>
I had to climb outside 
down girders and iron lattices.
Finally I got to the water level.
There were pirates who chased me
but I managed to make it accross 
the street.
Pretty much everyone here was
a risk for being attacked.
I managed to cross the water 
in the street to a place where there
was dark, dirty water up a 
hill and police were there
next to it.

I had gotten out once before

But this was a major shipment.
I wondered how we were going

that the driver was one of their
own cops.
Gayatri and I were lying in one

I had a face mask on.
Gayatri was quite agitated.
I took the face mask off 
and put it on her.
Then she relaxed and
slept, lying in my arms.

We got to the border and
were told to wait.
We were nervous about getting
through but had to calm ourselves

I just flew up into the

The good fairy was flying

I was able to fly as well

There was a door.
We took off the door.
The door slid down the stairs
and we lost it.
It split apart into pieces.
There were four children there
and they were going to have to
pay for it.
It would be $100.
I told them that I would
pay for it and they could

It was odd that it would have
gone anywhere execpt that the
place was pretty messy.
We stared looking all around.
Eventually the other person
whose cards they were
found them along the edge 
of the wall.
They had already been put back in 
their box.

The second bathroom

I was in the college dorm.
I went to the room accross

There was an older lady  there.
I invited her to get lunch.
Her English wasn't good.
We agreed to meet later.
Some other time.
I had to coordinate with the
teacher as well.
I went back and forth from
the teacher's office to
the dorm hallway to 
arrange this.
</p>

<p>
I got on my broom 
which was a push broom.
With it I could hop
and jump much faster 
than walking.
</p>

<p>
No one else was doing 
this but I didn't care.
</p>

<p>
I went back to the dorm hallway.
A young man was coming
out of the dorm room across 
the hall from my room.
He explained that the 
lady I had been talking to
was only there once a month.
</p>

<p>
It was his mom who came to
help him clean, and I had
mistaken her for another
mature student and 
blamed the misunderstanding

fill up the entire hour.
</p>

<p>
We went into the next room

It had a button on it that
said read voicemail.
This then explained how to

<p>
Once we started the game we 
were in a hallway.
The hallway was like 
a hallway at school.
Each room corrseponded to 
a different part of the game.
The first chapter of the game
was way down near the end of
the hallway on the ground floor.
This seemed counterintuitive.

We insisted that they write it
down on the agenda for the president.

When the president answered they

Basically it was going to be your

anything about it.

<p>
When we talked to the president,
catching her in the hallway

she only wanted to talk about

<p>
We were planning carpeting for the 
walls and ceiling (not the floor)
of a room in our new house.
</p>

<p>
A lady was working with us 
as the interior designer.
A guy I didn't know was asking
about the various options.
</p>

<p>
She was reluctant to wrap 
the carpet from one
surface to another but said
that they <i>could</i> do it if necessary
by leaving a gap between 
four inches and two feet.
The gap of four inches would 
cost more of course.
</p>

<p>
The guy who was choosing this with me
said that he wanted the four inch option.
I stayed quiet thinking about
if money was not an object
how much this was going to 
cost and if we could really 
afford it.
</p>

<p>
The guy and the interior 
design lady talked about 
which walls they should put it on.
</p>

<p>
The room we were in had the 
door in the northwest corner.
There was a sink and stove
along the west wall.
Windows were in the east wall
and they overlooked the 
river Thames which flowed
past right outside.
</p>

<p>
The guy said he wanted the carpet
along the south and west walls.
I wondered how they would get
past the kitchen area but I
guessed that they would 
figure that out.
</p>

<p>
At first I said that that I
liked the idea, because it
was best from an aesthetic sense.
But then I changed my mind and
said that I didn't like it
because you would have to move
the plumbing.
They paused to think about that.
</p>

<p>
I went over to the window and
looked out at the river.
People were canoeing down the
river, a tributary of which
 flowed from rightto left 
(south to north) 
outside the window 
and then met the larger river
further to the north.
</p>

<p>
I saw a canoe float by empty.
I wondered where its owner
had gotten to;
if they had fallen in.
Then a another canoe floated 
by empty and yet a third right
behind it.

Something very important was
happening the next day.
There would be drink there 
and I wondered if I should have
one drink the night before so that
it wouldn't affect me as much
by the difference.
I had to get there on my motorcycle.
On the way, I stopped at a place
and got out to shave.
It was a barbers but I didn't 
want them to shave me;
I just wanted to use their mirror.
</p>

<p>
But the guy kept looking over 
my shoulder and making me nervous.
He didn't seem to understand my
request just to do it myself.
Because he was a barber and
he figured he could do it.
</p>

<p>
I never finished as completely
as I might have liked.
Then I went back out 
and got on 
my motorcyle.
When I did I had a hard time
adjusting my backpack.
It was like it was a

I was on a city street near downtown.
I thought I would wait a while

There wasn't any work.
</p>

<p>
It started to get cold 
so I started to drive away.
I negotiated a right turn
at the stop light ahead.
</p>

<p>
I drove along some residential streets.
Two young men came out to
partially block my way
so I accelerated past them and
just kept going faster
even though the street narrowed.
The streets were like 
those in East St. Paul

East was facing South"

A small child was playing

just went right onto the
lawn to avoid them and 
kept going at my same speed.

<p>
The road narrowed even more

ragged path adjacent to a park.

the father in 
Home Before Dark.
He had a hard time

to school on time
and had many other 
symptoms of alcoholism
but he never drank
and never had.
</p>

<p>
His wife went to work.
She didn't always
tell him the truth 
about what she did.
</p>

<p>
Halloween was coming.
His daughter was there
with some of her friends.
She asked him if
the Mugwumps would 
come on Halloween again
this year.
The father thought no.
She asked again.
He said, well alright,
one last time.
One final visitation 
from the Mugwumps.
</p>

<p>
So he went over to 
the side of the house
and started pissing
into an electrical outlet.
</p>

<p>
He had to reach his hand out
to open the outlet up
so that he could piss inside.
</p>

<p>
After he was done with that
he opened up the adjacent
electrical outlet to reveal
that it was a hidden compartment.
From it, after some difficulty,
he pulled out a pail of pebbles.
The pebbles were all rounded
and seemed still moist though
they were dry.
They had all come from the
swamp where the Mugwumps lived.
They were the pebbles that
could summon the Mugwumps.
As he walked away carrying 
the pail, you could see that
he had gotten his hand wet
and that it had started to 
turn green and scaly, 
distorted and bumpy in places.
</p>

<p>
The Mugwumps were intelligent
creatures about the size of
a large dog and with skin
like a toad, but regular
legs made for land, not 
rear legs made for hopping
as a toad has.
</p>

<p>
They peered out over a ridge
at the edge of their swamp
into the nearby villiage.
Will we go into the town
for halloween tonight?
Only if we are called,
only if we are called.
</p>

<p>
The father, his daughter
and several of her friends
were standing in the driveway
outside their house.
He had the pail of pebbles.
It was dusk but 
not yet sunset.
The Mugwumps would not 
come until actual sunset.
The pebbles were both the
bait that would bring them in
and the missiles that would
drive them away.
</p>

<p>
The children started casting
the pebbles about in the street.
They were playing and doing so 
at such a rate that it was 
questionable if there would be
enough pebbles left to 
drive the Mugwumps away 
after they came to get the 
pebbles that were being 
used as bait.
</p>

<p>
Other ghostly creatures
of various sizes from the 
size of a small cat to the
size of an elephant started to
appear out of nothing
and float down the street.
</p>

<p>
But these were not the Mugwumps
and they were niether interested
in the pebbles nor could they be
harmed by them.  
Also it was not sunset yet.

a square bench where she used to be.
You kind of knew that she was in there,

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org582b14f">
<p>
We were in the room in the
southeast corner
of Vincent hall,
the math building
on the U of M campus.
</p>

<p>
There was a cereal commercial
playing between children's cartoons
That included a panel that 
was something to the effect of
<code>123.234.345</code>
it was supposed to be 
like an IP address except
it wasn't actually an IP address
they were just trying to 
take advantage of a 
tech vibe to sell their cereal.
</p>

<p>
I complained that they were using
the numbers as symbols.
There was no possibility of 
addition or mulitplication 
or any other operations on 
these numbers;
they could be replaced with any
other set of symbols.
So I proposed &#x2013; and here
is where it gets tounge in cheeky &#x2013;
that we could create a new set of symbols.
The first could be a circle, the second
a line, the third a squiggle, 
and then two cups on their sides
and so on.
</p>

<p>
They didn't understand what I was saying
or couldn't hear.
Someone tried drawing two cups on their sides
but instead drew a cupboard on its side.
It was actually a very detailed Ikea-like drawing.
That person was a little older and 
from an eastern european country.
</p>

<p>
So I got up to the whiteboard to repeat
myself for everyone in the room.
It wasn't a class.
It was more like a couple of different
classes mixing between two classes.
There was already a lot of writing
on the whiteboard and I couldn't
erase it.
The only marker I had was red.
I wrote in the lower right corner.
I was afraid that it would be illegible.
It was just barely legible.
</p>

<p>
I started explaining again,
going over the whole story
of how the cereal commercial's numbers
could just be replaced by a set of symbols.
For example the first symbol could be a circle: 0.
Then the second symbol could be a line:  1.
The third symbol could be a squiqqle:  2.
Then two cups on their side:  3.
Then an upside-down chair:  4.
Then a sinuous line:  5.
And so on.
Then everybody got the joke and
I stepped back down from the whiteboard.

<h3 id="org62d7897">Leave your keys</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org62d7897">
<p>
I was in a care home.
It was like Carriage House
and it was also like a 
room in my grandparents house
that I was staying in.
My dad was coming to pick me up
to take me to my real home.
But first he was going to 
drop me off at Macalester.
</p>

<p>
I went to grab my keys
which were lying on a shelf.
I realized that I didn't need to take
them with because I could just come
back here from school before going to 
my real home and get them.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org63d4365" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org63d4365">The pillars</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org63d4365">
<p>
We walked into the library
in Macalester
which was a huge building with
four or five floors and high ceilings.
The bookshelves were spaced widely.
People were milling about.
Some exploring the books, 
others getting from
one place to another
as this building was central
for connections throughout
the school.
There were wide escalators
going up and down that
were constantly busy with people.
</p>

<p>
There were two carved brown
wooden pillars that hung 
from the ceiling &#x2013; not reaching 
even halfway to the floor &#x2013;
in the main lobby.
These had been part of the 
inauguration ceremony for the building
but were now pretty well forgotten.
</p>

<p>
One of them came loose.
For some reason having come
loose was related to me.
Because it was all painted brown
you could hardly make out what the
carvings were.
No contrast.
And when they were 10 feet above people
hanging from the ceiling any 
meaning in the carvings was certainly lost.
A maintenance person came over to 
start to repair it.
</p>

<p>
My father came over and 
said that it was time to go.
</p>

<p>
I thought that really there was no
point in repairing it.
They could replace it with something
much more modern.
Much more colorful.
</p>

<p>
So I went to look for the people
who were fixing the column so 
that I could explain this to them.
I went up the escalator to the 
next floor.
I looked around some of 
the bookshelves.
A young student was debating
whether this large 
oversized book &#x2013; easily a meter &#x2013;
was filed under the correct place
in the dewey decimal system.
When I looked, apparently it was.
</p>

<p>
The building was so large that it
opened out onto some park areas.
There were no walls; you just 
went slowly from library to park
with the library tables and bookshelves
thinning out and grass and
picnic benches increasing.
This way you could choose
your level of comfort if you
liked to read in the park.
The tables were so spread out that I thought 
that it would be great for 
some solitary study.
</p>

<p>
But how did you stay warm in the winter?
This was not an issue at this time
as the weather was quite comfortable.
But there were no walls.
Apparently they just kept the heating on
blowing warm air out of the 
building that it was warm
all the way to the end.
This didn't seem very 
efficient or sustainable 
but apparently they had
worked it out.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't find the people responsible
for the repair of the column.
It had been over an hour.
I wondered why my father or the
other people we were with hadn't 
called or texted to find out 
where I was.
</p>

<p>
I looked at my phone and sure enough
there were some missed texts.
My phone was frozen and I had to
reboot it which was why I
hadn't realized that I had 
gotten the texts.
</p>

<p>
I rebooted and went back down
to the first floor to find
my father and the others.
</p>

<p>
They were nowhere to be seen
so I went outside to the street
by myself.
</p>

<h3 id="orgb141707">Maybe not a good investment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb141707">
<p>
I turned right outside the 
entrance to the library 
and walked along the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
I was going to be recieving
$100,000 which I had planned
to use a good chunk of to 
pay for another year of school.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking that by investing
in another year of school I
was going to be able to 
<i>exponentially</i> increase my options.
But then I thought 
what if that didn't happen?
What if by giving myself the extra
year I didn't somehow find 
quantitatively many new options?
</p>

<p>
Then spending the money just to
float for another year wouldn't
really be such a good investment.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge1b69e6">
<p>
I went back to the library.
But this time evil people
were doing bad things.  
I tried to get up to the 
top floor in the corner where
it was happening.
</p>

<p>
I had to cut away at cables
that were running water
and other food and storage containers
as I went up the escalators.
</p>

<p>
People were being led into a room 
in the corner and there was
a conveyor belt of items
including potted plants coming out
from the other side of the room.
</p>

<p>
"You are killing them!" I yelled.
"No, they are still alive," came the response.
"They are these trees!."  
Bwah ha ha.

<p>
We were leaving Thermo King.
Because I had a guitar,
a balalaika
and a ukelele
I thought I would order an Uber
instead of taking the bus 
like everybody else was.
</p>

<p>
So I opened my phone 
(it was fold sized)
and opened the app.
It was made to look
like the dashboard of a VW
and told you about how
easy it was to use.
Just push the button!
</p>

<p>
So well I pushed the button
and the app decided that
since I already had a car
(which was the VW)
that it would just auto drive
me home instead of getting
a different car to come.
</p>

<p>
Except that I hadn't put
my three guitars in the trunk.
So I pushed the stop button
so that I could go back and
get my guitars.
</p>

<p>
Except that we were in traffic
so it couldn't stop right away.
It just kept pulling over
on to side streets farther 
and farther away from where I
wanted to be and
going further and further
downhill..

Me Dan Smith and a lady
were at work.
I said why don't we all
go to lunch on Thursday.
She said she couldn't because
she had a 9 PM meeting.
9 PM?!  
That's too late!
What she really wanted to do
was fly overnight for the meeting.
</p>

<p>
We told her just ask your 
boss for authorization.
I said she should go for the
whole weekend but she
seemed to think that flying
all the way there for just one night
was fine.
</p>

<p>
We went down a hallway 
which was like a hallway
in Mechanic Arts
and she was trying to find an
empty office to study in.
Tim Walker was in the 
office on the end.
He was picking up 
something from under his desk.
She waved to him
and when she saw that his
office wasn't empty she 
went into the office next door.
I followed her in
still wanting to talk
about lunch and travel plans.
Then Tim came in to
chat as well.

I was going back to school to try to get my high school degree.
I got two tapes which had my 11th and 12th grade record on them, but it turned out that the 11th grade was just the raw score and the 12th grade was still blank.
There were a lot of red numbers on the 11th grade tape so I was worried that I would have to go back for another year.

Then as they were leaving, they were hitching their trailer up to truck to take it out, but somebody else took the trailer and hit it up to a semi. And then they were riding down the street. The semi didn't know that they were behind them. It was bitter cold and they were trying to get the semi's attention.

We were shouting at them to tell them it was unsafe.

There was a class that I was in and I was going to be, I had skipped some classes so I was going to miss the final exam but I had a whole bunch of notes.

I asked this girl who for some reason was in the living room of 1377 if she wanted to help me with working on the Haskell program.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org53df4f2">
<p>
I was on a bike trip with my father.
He parked the car and we went off biking
down some trails and over hills.
Along some bike paths.
The path split two ways and I 
took the right most closet
to where the highway was.
</p>

<p>
Then he said that he was tired and 
we'd best stop for the night.
I might have continued for a while longer.
</p>

<p>
He said that we should get the car that
we had parked.
He asked if I could get it.
I said that I couldn't.
There was no way I could remember
where it was and I would just
end up walking the streets
aimlessly for the rest of the dream
which I didn't want to do.
</p>

<p>
So he went and got it.
How we were going to do
miles of biking accross country and
into the next state all the while
coming back to where we had left the 
car in the morning was not made clear.
</p>

<p>
We got in the car and he handed me a map.
He was driving.
I had to find Minneapolis,
except this was't the Minneapolis in 
Minnesota where we started, it was
the one that was a suburb of 
Indianapolis in Indiana where
we had biked to. 
It was an old map with the 
interstate in yellow like we used to
have before cell phones.
I kept turning it over
where it had a map of the world and
turning it upside down to try to
find it but I couldn't see anything
except Indianapolis and other suburbs.
</p>

<p>
Finally we ended up at a restaurant 
with a few other people.
It wasn't a fancy place, it was
more the kind of place that he liked.
They didn't have beer and liquour.
We all ordered sweet drinks.
I got the lemon lime one.
